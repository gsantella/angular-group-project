CompTIA A+ Guide to IT Technical Support, Eleventh Edition was written to be the very best tool on the market
today to prepare you to support users and their resources on networks, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, virtual
machines, and in the cloud. This edition has been updated to include the most current hardware and software technologies; this text takes you from the just-a-user level to the I-can-fix-this level for hardware, software, networks,
and virtual computing infrastructures. It achieves its goals with an unusually effective combination of tools that
powerfully reinforce both concepts and hands-on, real-world experiences. It also provides thorough preparation for
the content on the new CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2 Certification exams. Competency in using a computer is a
prerequisite to using this text. No background knowledge of electronics or networking is assumed. An appropriate
prerequisite course for this text would be a general course in computer applications.
This text includes:
• Several in-depth, hands-on projects at the end of each module that invite you to immediately apply and
reinforce critical thinking and troubleshooting skills and are designed to make certain that you not only
understand the material but also execute procedures and make decisions on your own.
• Comprehensive review and practice end-of-module material, including a module summary, key terms list,
critical thinking questions that focus on the type of scenarios you might expect on A+ exam questions, and
real-world problems to solve.
• Step-by-step instructions on installation, maintenance, optimization of system performance, and
troubleshooting.
• A wide array of photos, drawings, and screenshots support the text, displaying in detail the exact software
and hardware features you will need to understand to set up, maintain, and troubleshoot physical and virtual
computers and small networks.
In addition, the carefully structured, clearly written text is accompanied by graphics that provide the visual
input essential to learning and to help students master difficult subject matter. For instructors using the text in a
classroom, instructor resources are available online.
Coverage is balanced—while focusing on new technologies and software, including virtualization, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and Windows 10/11, the text also covers the real world of an IT support technician,
where some older technologies remain in widespread use and still need support. For example, the text covers M.2
motherboard slots and NVMe, the latest drive interface standard for solid-state devices (SSDs), but also addresses
how to install SSDs and magnetic hard drives using the older Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) interfaces. The text focuses on Windows 10, the most popular operating system for desktops and laptops, but also covers

almost every module. In addition, the Core 1 module “Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer
Problems” gives insights into general approaches to troubleshooting that help apply the specifics detailed in
each module for different hardware and software problems. Several Core 2 modules focus on troubleshooting
networks, applications, and Windows.
• Step-by-Step Procedures. The text is chock-full of step-by-step procedures covering subjects from hardware
and operating system installations and maintenance to troubleshooting the boot process or a failed network
connection and optimizing system performance.
• Visual Learning. Numerous visually detailed photographs, three-dimensional art, and screenshots support
the text, displaying hardware and software features exactly as you will see them in your work.
• CompTIA A+ Objectives Mapped to Modules. This table lists the module that provides the primary content
for each certification objective on the A+ exams. This is a valuable tool for quick reference.
• Applying Concepts. These sections offer real-life, practical applications for the material being discussed.
Whether outlining a task, developing a scenario, or providing pointers, the Applying Concepts sections
give you a chance to apply what you’ve learned to a typical computer or network problem, so you can

What’s Inside a Desktop Case
Now that you’re familiar with the outside of the case, let’s open the case to see what is inside. Here are the steps to
open a computer case:
1. Back up important data. If you are starting with a working computer, make sure important data is
backed up first. Copy the data to an external storage device such as a flash drive or external hard drive.
If something goes wrong while you’re working inside the computer, at least your data will be safe.
2. Power down the system and unplug it. Remove discs from the optical drive. Then power down the
system, and unplug the power, monitor, mouse, and keyboard cables and any other peripherals or cables
attached. Then move these cables out of your way.
Figure 1-7 A loopback plug testing a network port and network cable
Figure 1-8 Press the power button after the computer is unplugged
Caution
When you power down a computer and even turn off the power switch on the rear of the computer case, residual power
is still on. Some motherboards have a small light inside the case to remind you of this fact and to warn you that power
is still getting to the system. Therefore, be sure to always unplug the power cord before opening a case.
3. Press and hold down the power button for a moment. After you unplug the computer, press the power
button for about three seconds to completely drain the power supply (see Figure 1-8). Sometimes when
you do so, you’ll hear the fans quickly start and go off as residual power is drained. Only then is it safe
to work inside the case.

so you know exactly what
topics and skills are covered.
Introduction
Like many other computer users, you have probably used your personal computer to play games, check your email,
write papers, or build Excel worksheets. This text takes you from being an end user of your computer to becoming an
information technology (IT) support technician able to support all types of personal computers. The only assumption made here is that you are a computer user—that is, you can turn on your machine, load a software package,
and use that software to accomplish a task. No experience in electronics is assumed.
As an IT support technician, you’ll want to become A1 certified, which is the industry standard certification
for IT support technicians. This text prepares you to pass the A1 220-1101 Core 1 and 220-1102 Core 2 exams by
CompTIA (comptia.org). The exams are required by CompTIA for A1 certification.
In this module, you take apart and reassemble a desktop computer and laptop while discovering the various
hardware components inside the cases. You also learn about the tools you need to work inside the case.
Exam Tip
As you work your way through the modules and the appendix, notice the A1 Core 1 and Core 2 exam objective numbers
that follow certain headings. This information identifies how the content maps to the exam objectives. In the text, A1
Core 1 objective numbers are tagged in teal, and A1 Core 2 objective numbers are tagged in orange. After studying
each module or appendix, take a look at the grid at the beginning of this text, and make sure you understand each
objective listed in the grid for the module or appendix just completed.
Taking apart and servicing a computer are tasks that every A1 certified technician needs to know how to do. As
part of your preparation to become A1 certified, try to find old desktop and laptop computers you can take apart.
If you can locate the service manual for a laptop, you should be able to take it apart, repair it (assuming the parts
are still available and don’t cost more than the computer is worth), and get it up and running again. Have fun with
this module, and enjoy tinkering with these computers!
Exploring a Desktop Computer
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 2.8, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
In this section of the module, you learn how to take apart a desktop computer and put it back together. This skill is
needed in this module and others as you learn to add or replace computer parts inside the case and perhaps even
build a system from scratch. As you read the following steps, you might want to refer to the Hands-On Projects at
the end of the module, which allow you to follow along by taking a computer apart. As you do so, be sure to follow
all the safety precautions found in the appendix “Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns.” In the steps that
follow, each major computer component is identified and described. You learn much more about each component
later in the text. Take your time—don’t rush—as you take apart a computer for the first time. It can be a great learning experience or an expensive disaster! As you work, pay attention to the details and work with care.
Protecting Yourself and the Equipment
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 3.4
Protecting yourself and the equipment is essential for having a positive experience working inside a computer. When
you follow the safety guidelines, you will be more likely to successfully complete your task and enjoy yourself while
doing it. Remember to always ask your instructor for help if you have any questions about safety.
Follow these guidelines to protect yourself:
●● Remove loose jewelry that might get caught in cables and components as you work.
●● As you work, watch out for sharp edges on computer cases that can cut you.

Form Factors Used by Desktop Cases, Power Supplies, and Motherboards
The desktop computer case, power supply, and motherboard must all be compatible and fit together as an interconnecting system. The standards that describe the size, shape, screw hole positions, and major features of these
interconnected components are called form factors. Using a matching form factor for the motherboard, power
 supply, and case assures you that
If you ever need to change the dual-voltage selector switch, be sure you first turn off the computer and unplug the
power supply.

Manage Cellular Data and Roaming
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 1.4
Looking back at Figure 9-14, you can see that a smartphone can use cellular data or Wi-Fi to access the Internet. In certain
situations, you might want to disable cellular data or disable cellular roaming. The advantage of disabling cellular data
and using Wi-Fi for data transmissions is that Wi-Fi transmissions are not charged against your cellular data subscription
plan. Also, Wi-Fi is generally faster than most cellular connections. (When you disable cellular data, you can still send SMS
texts because these texts use the carrier’s network and not the Internet.) Disabling roaming can prevent roaming charges
on your bill incurred from using other carriers’ cellular networks when you travel outside your home territory.
To disable roaming on an Android device, go to the Network & internet menu in the Settings app, tap Mobile
network, and then disable Roaming. On an iOS device, open the Settings app, tap Cellular (see Figure 9-16A), and
turn off Cellular Data. Next, tap Cellular Data Options, and then turn off roaming. On the Cellular Data Options
screen, you can also turn on Low Data Mode to conserve cellular data usage. See Figure 9-16B.
Applying Concepts
Figure 9-16  Control (A) data usages and (B) data
roaming in iOS
(A) (B)
If you have roaming enabled,
especially for a CDMA device,
you’ll want to keep the Preferred
Roaming List (PRL) updated.
The PRL is a database file that
lists the preferred service providers or radio frequencies your carrier wants the device to use when
outside your home network. To
update the PRL, follow instructions
from your carrier. For example, for
Verizon, you dial *228, and select
2 to update your PRL. When the
update completes, a message
appears on your phone. For an
Android phone, you then need to
power down the device and turn
it back on.
Like desktop computers, a mobile device can be configured to communicate information securely over a virtual private
network (VPN) connection. To create a VPN connection, in the Android Settings app, tap Connections, More connection
settings, and VPN. In iOS Settings, tap General, VPN. To set up the VPN, you’ll need to know the type of encryption

Some Android smartphones provide information about the device when you enter *#*#4636#*#* in the phone’s dialer
keypad. In the screen that appears, select Battery Information. If the Battery Health screen reports “unknown,” suspect
a bad battery. The screen also reports the temperature of the battery, which should be less than 40°C.
Note 13
Module Summary
Mobile Devices, Operating Systems, Connections, and Accessories
●● An IT support technician might be called on to service mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets,
and, therefore, needs to know the basics of using and supporting Android, iOS, and iPadOS mobile operating systems.
●● A mobile device might have several antennas for wireless connections—primarily Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth,
NFC, and cellular. The device uses a Wi-Fi or cellular antenna to connect to a LAN (local area network), a
WAN (wide area network), or to create its own hotspot, and it uses Bluetooth or NFC to connect to a PAN
(personal area network). A wired connection might use a microUSB, miniUSB, USB-C, or proprietary port,
such as the Lightning port by Apple, for syncing with a computer or tethering to provide the computer with
cellular WAN access.
Mobile Apps for Business Use
●● Large corporations use mobile device management (MDM) software on mobile devices to secure and back
up their content on the device. Mobile application management (MAM) software enhances MDM by providing additional protection for corporate apps and data.
●● Email can be accessed on a mobile device through an email client embedded in the mobile OS or through
third-party commercial mail apps. Microsoft Exchange is a private enterprise email service that is hosted
on corporation or ISP servers.
●● Syncing mirrors app data and other content among your devices and the cloud. Apple and Google both
offer syncing that is linked to your Apple or Google account. In addition, Microsoft offers Microsoft 365 and
OneDrive or SharePoint syncing as do other software and cloud providers.
Troubleshooting Mobile Devices
●● To troubleshoot a mobile device using tools in the OS, you can close running apps, uninstall and reinstall
an app, update the OS, and restart and reboot the device.
●● Common problems a technician might face when supporting mobile devices include malware, malfunctioning touch response, digitizer issues, a broken screen, connectivity issues, damaged ports, liquid damage,
improper charging, poor battery health, overheating, and a swollen battery.

Introduction
Like many other computer users, you have probably used your personal computer to play games, check your email,
write papers, or build Excel worksheets. This text takes you from being an end user of your computer to becoming an
information technology (IT) support technician able to support all types of personal computers. The only assumption made here is that you are a computer user—that is, you can turn on your machine, load a software package,
and use that software to accomplish a task. No experience in electronics is assumed.
As an IT support technician, you’ll want to become A1 certified, which is the industry standard certification
for IT support technicians. This text prepares you to pass the A1 220-1101 Core 1 and 220-1102 Core 2 exams by
CompTIA (comptia.org). The exams are required by CompTIA for A1 certification.
In this module, you take apart and reassemble a desktop computer and laptop while discovering the various
hardware components inside the cases. You also learn about the tools you need to work inside the case.
Exam Tip
As you work your way through the modules and the appendix, notice the A1 Core 1 and Core 2 exam objective numbers
that follow certain headings. This information identifies how the content maps to the exam objectives. In the text, A1
Core 1 objective numbers are tagged in teal, and A1 Core 2 objective numbers are tagged in orange. After studying
each module or appendix, take a look at the grid at the beginning of this text, and make sure you understand each
objective listed in the grid for the module or appendix just completed.
Taking apart and servicing a computer are tasks that every A1 certified technician needs to know how to do. As
part of your preparation to become A1 certified, try to find old desktop and laptop computers you can take apart.
If you can locate the service manual for a laptop, you should be able to take it apart, repair it (assuming the parts
are still available and don’t cost more than the computer is worth), and get it up and running again. Have fun with
this module, and enjoy tinkering with these computers!
Exploring a Desktop Computer
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 2.8, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
In this section of the module, you learn how to take apart a desktop computer and put it back together. This skill is
needed in this module and others as you learn to add or replace computer parts inside the case and perhaps even
build a system from scratch. As you read the following steps, you might want to refer to the Hands-On Projects at
the end of the module, which allow you to follow along by taking a computer apart. As you do so, be sure to follow
all the safety precautions found in the appendix “Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns.” In the steps that
follow, each major computer component is identified and described. You learn much more about each component
later in the text. Take your time—don’t rush—as you take apart a computer for the first time. It can be a great learning experience or an expensive disaster! As you work, pay attention to the details and work with care.
Protecting Yourself and the Equipment
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 3.4
Protecting yourself and the equipment is essential for having a positive experience working inside a computer. When
you follow the safety guidelines, you will be more likely to successfully complete your task and enjoy yourself while
doing it. Remember to always ask your instructor for help if you have any questions about safety.
Follow these guidelines to protect yourself:
●● Remove loose jewelry that might get caught in cables and components as you work.
●● As you work, watch out for sharp edges on computer cases that can cut you.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Consider the monitor and the power supply to be “black boxes.” Never remove the cover or put your hands
inside this equipment unless you know about the hazards of charged capacitors and have been trained to deal
with them. The power supply and monitor contain enough power to kill you, even when they are unplugged.
●● Power down the system and unplug it.
●● For a computer, press and hold down the power button for three seconds to completely drain any residual
power in the power supply.
●● Never, ever touch the inside of a computer that is turned on. The one exception to this rule is when you’re
using a multimeter to measure voltage output.
Follow these guidelines to protect the equipment:
●● Always wear an ESD strap (also called a ground bracelet, antistatic wrist strap, or ESD bracelet), which protects against electrostatic discharge when working inside the computer case. Electrostatic discharge (ESD)
is another name for static electricity, which can damage chips and destroy motherboards, even though it
might not be felt or seen with the naked eye. When you use the strap to connect or ground your hand to the
case, as shown in Figure 1-1, any static electricity between you and the case is dissipated.
Figure 1-1 An ESD strap, which protects computer components
from ESD, can clip to the side of the computer case
and eliminate ESD between you and the case
Figure 1-2 An ESD mat dissipates ESD and should be connected to the ground
●● If an ESD strap is unavailable or won't work, use a ground mat, also called an ESD mat, to dissipate ESD (see
Figure 1-2). While the equipment is resting on the ground mat, it is protected from ESD; however, if you lift
the equipment off the mat, it is no longer protected, unless you are wearing an ESD strap.

●● Place equipment in a static shielding bag, also called an antistatic bag. These bags act as a type of Faraday
cage, named after Michael Faraday, who built the first cage in 1836. A Faraday cage is any device that protects against an electromagnetic field. Save antistatic bags as you find them, and use them whenever you
take a piece of equipment out of a computer. Remember that a device that is set on top of an antistatic bag
is not protected; it is only protected when it is placed inside the bag (see Figure 1-3).
Figure 1-3 An antistatic bag helps protect components from ESD
It’s important to know how to stay safe when working inside computers. Before opening a computer case and using the
tools described in this section, be sure to read the appendix “Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns.” As you
work inside a computer, follow all the safety guidelines discussed in that appendix.
Core to Core
Step 1: Planning and Organizing Your Work and Gathering Your Tools
Core 1 Objectives 2.8, 3.4
When you begin to learn how to work inside a computer case, make it a point to practice good organizational skills.
If you keep your notes, tools, screws, and computer parts well organized, your work goes more smoothly and is
more fun. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
●● As you work, make notes using pencil and paper, and perhaps take photos with your cell phone so you can
backtrack later if necessary. (When you’re first learning to take a computer apart, it’s easy to forget where
everything fits when it’s time to put the computer back together. Also, in troubleshooting, you want to avoid
repeating actions or overlooking things to try.)
●● Don’t stack boards on top of each other. You could accidentally dislodge a chip this way. When you remove
a circuit board or drive from a computer, carefully lay it on an antistatic mat or set it in an antistatic bag in
a place where it won’t get bumped.
●● When handling motherboards, cards, or drives, don’t touch the chips on the device. Hold expansion cards
by the edges. Don’t touch any soldered components on a card, and don’t touch the edge connectors unless
it’s absolutely necessary. All this helps prevent damage from static electricity. Also, fingerprints on the edge
connectors can cause later corrosion.
●● To prevent damage to a microchip, don’t touch it with a magnetized screwdriver.

●● To stay organized and avoid losing small parts, keep screws and spacers orderly and in one place, such as
a cup or tray.
●● In a classroom environment, after you have reassembled everything, have your instructor check your work
before you put the cover back on and power up.
Tools Used by a Computer Hardware Technician
Every IT support technician who plans to repair desktop or laptop computers or mobile devices needs a handy toolbox with a few essential tools. Several hardware and software tools can help you maintain a computer and diagnose
and repair computer problems. The tools you choose depend on the amount of money you can spend and the level
of hardware support you expect to provide.
Essential tools for computer hardware troubleshooting are listed here, and several of them are shown in
Figure 1-4. You can purchase some of these tools in a computer toolkit, although most toolkits contain items you
really can do without.
Figure 1-4 Tools used by IT support technicians when maintaining, repairing, or
upgrading computers
Here is a list of essential tools:
●● An ESD strap (also called a ground bracelet)
●● Flathead screwdriver
●● Phillips-head or crosshead screwdriver
●● Torx screwdriver set, particularly size T15
●● Tweezers, preferably insulated ones, for picking pieces of paper out of printers or dropped screws out of
tight places
●● Software, including recovery DVDs or USB recovery drives for any operating system (OS) you might work
on (you might need several, depending on the OSs you support), antivirus software on bootable DVDs or
USB flash drives, and diagnostic software
The following tools might not be essential, but they are very convenient to have on hand:
●● Cans of compressed air (see Figure 1-5), small portable compressor, or antistatic vacuum cleaner to clean
dust from inside a computer case
●● Cleaning solutions and pads such as contact cleaner, monitor wipes, and cleaning solutions for CDs and DVDs
●● Multimeter to check cables and the power supply output
●● Power supply tester
●● POST diagnostic cards
●● Needle-nose pliers for removing jumpers and for holding objects in place while you screw them in (especially
handy for those pesky nuts on cable connectors)

●● Cable ties to keep cables out of the way inside
a computer case
●● Flashlight to see inside the computer case
●● AC outlet ground tester
●● Network cable tester
●● Loopback plugs to test ports
●● Small cups or bags to help keep screws organized as you work
●● Antistatic bags to store unused parts
●● Pen and paper for taking notes
Keep your tools in a toolbox designated for
hardware troubleshooting. If you put discs and
hardware tools in the same box, be sure to keep
the discs inside a hard plastic case to protect them
from scratches and dents. In addition, make sure
the diagnostic and utility software you use is recommended for the hardware and software you are
troubleshooting.
Now that you’ve prepared your work area and tools, put on your ESD strap—let’s get started with opening the
computer case.
Step 2: Opening the Case
Core 1 Objectives 2.8, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5
Before we discuss the parts inside a desktop case, let’s take a quick look at the outside of the case and the ports
and switches on it.
What’s on the Outside of a Desktop Case
A computer case for any type of computer is sometimes called
the chassis, and it houses the power supply, motherboard, processor, memory modules, expansion cards, hard drive, optical drive, and other drives. A computer case can be a tower
case, a desktop case that lies flat on a desk, an all-in-one case
used with an all-in-one computer, or a mobile case used with
laptops and tablets. A tower case (see Figure 1-6) sits upright;
it can be as high as two feet and has room for several drives.
Often used for servers, this type of case is also good for desktop computer users who anticipate upgrading because tower
cases provide maximum space for working inside a computer
and moving components around. A desktop case lies flat and
sometimes serves double-duty as a monitor stand. Later in this
module, you learn how to work inside a tower case, desktop
case, laptop case, and all-in-one case.

Don’t lay a tower case on its side when the computer is
in use because the CD or DVD drive might not work properly. For the same reason, if a desktop case is designed to
lie flat, don’t set it on its end when the computer is in use.

Port Description
A VGA (Video Graphics Array) port—also called a DB-15 port, DB15 port,
HD15 port, or DE15 port—is a 15-pin, D-shaped, female port that transmits
analog video. (Analog means a continuous signal with infinite variations as
compared with digital, which is a series of binary values—1s and 0s.) All
older monitors use VGA ports. (By the way, the HD15 [high-definition 15-pin]
name for the port is an older name that distinguishes it from the early 9-pin
VGA ports.)
A DVI (Digital Video Interface) port transmits digital or analog video. You
learn about the three types of DVI ports in the module “Supporting I/O
Devices.”
An HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port transmits digital
video and audio (not analog transmissions) and is often used to connect to
home theater equipment.
A DisplayPort transmits digital video and audio (not analog transmissions)
and is slowly replacing VGA and DVI ports on personal computers.
A Thunderbolt 3 port transmits video, data, and power on the same port
and cable and is popular with Apple computers. The port is shaped the
same as the USB-C port and is compatible with USB-C devices. Up to six
peripherals (for example, monitors and external hard drives daisy-chained
together) can use the same Thunderbolt port.
A system usually has three or more round audio ports, also called sound
ports, for a microphone, audio in, audio out, and stereo audio out. These
types of audio ports can transmit analog or digital data. If you have one
audio cable to connect to a speaker or earbuds, plug it into the lime green
sound port in the middle of the three ports. The microphone uses the pink
port.
Table 1-1 Ports used with desktop and laptop computers
(continues)
Table 1-1 lists ports you might find on a desktop or mobile computer. Consider this table your introduction to
these ports so you can recognize them when you see them. Later in the text, you learn more about the details of
each port.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to identify the ports shown in Table 1-1.

Table 1-1 Ports used with desktop and laptop computers (Continued)
Port Description
An SPDIF (Sony-Philips Digital Interface) sound port connects to an
external home theater audio system, providing digital audio output and the
best signal quality. SPDIF ports always carry digital audio and can work with
electrical or optical cable. When connected to a fiber-optic cable, the port is
called an optical connector.
A USB (Universal Serial Bus) port is a multipurpose I/O port that comes
in several sizes and is used by many different devices, including printers,
mice, keyboards, scanners, external hard drives, and flash drives. Some USB
ports are faster than others. There are several USB standards, with speeds
consistently improving with each new release.
An external SATA (eSATA) port is used by an external hard drive or other
device using the eSATA interface.
A PS/2 port, also called a mini-DIN port, is a round 6-pin port used by a
keyboard or mouse. The ports look alike but are not interchangeable. On a
desktop, the purple port is for the keyboard, and the green port is for the
mouse. Most newer computers use USB ports for the keyboard and mouse
rather than the older PS/2 ports.
An older serial port, sometimes called a DB9 port, is a 9-pin male port used
on older computers. It has been mostly replaced by USB ports. Occasionally,
you see a serial port on a router, where the port is used to connect the
router to a device a technician can use to monitor and manage the router.
A modem port, also called an RJ-11 port, is used to connect dial-up phone
lines to computers. A modem port looks like a network port but is not as
wide. In the photo, the right port is a modem port, and the left port is a
network port shown for comparison.
A network port, also called an Ethernet port or an RJ-45 port, is used by
a network cable to connect to the wired network. Fast Ethernet ports run at
100 Mbps (megabits per second), and Gigabit Ethernet runs at 1000 Mbps or
1 Gbps (gigabits per second). A megabit is one million bits, and a gigabit is
one billion bits. A bit is a binary value of 1 or 0.
Loopback Plugs
A loopback plug is used to test a network port in a computer or other device to make sure the port is working. It
might also test the throughput or speed of the port. Figure 1-7 shows a loopback plug testing a network port on a
laptop. You know both the port and the network cable are good because the lights on either side of the port are lit.
You can also buy a USB loopback plug to test USB ports.

What’s Inside a Desktop Case
Now that you’re familiar with the outside of the case, let’s open the case to see what is inside. Here are the steps to
open a computer case:
1. Back up important data. If you are starting with a working computer, make sure important data is
backed up first. Copy the data to an external storage device such as a flash drive or external hard drive.
If something goes wrong while you’re working inside the computer, at least your data will be safe.
2. Power down the system and unplug it. Remove discs from the optical drive. Then power down the
system, and unplug the power, monitor, mouse, and keyboard cables and any other peripherals or cables
attached. Then move these cables out of your way.
Figure 1-7 A loopback plug testing a network port and network cable
Figure 1-8 Press the power button after the computer is unplugged
Caution
When you power down a computer and even turn off the power switch on the rear of the computer case, residual power
is still on. Some motherboards have a small light inside the case to remind you of this fact and to warn you that power
is still getting to the system. Therefore, be sure to always unplug the power cord before opening a case.
3. Press and hold down the power button for a moment. After you unplug the computer, press the power
button for about three seconds to completely drain the power supply (see Figure 1-8). Sometimes when
you do so, you’ll hear the fans quickly start and go off as residual power is drained. Only then is it safe
to work inside the case.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
4. Have a plastic bag or cup handy to hold screws. When you reassemble the computer, you will need
to insert the same screws in the same holes. This is especially important with the hard drive because
screws that are too long can puncture the hard drive housing, so be careful to label those screws
clearly.
5. Open the case cover. Sometimes, figuring out how to open a computer case is the most difficult part of
disassembling a computer. If you need help figuring it out, check the user manual or website of the case
manufacturer. To remove the computer case cover, do the following:
●● Some cases require you to start by laying the case on its side and removing the faceplate on the
front of the case first. Other cases require you to remove a side panel first, and much older cases
require you to first remove all the sides and top as a single unit. Study your case for the correct
approach.
●● Most cases have panels on each side that can be removed. It is usually necessary to remove only
one panel to expose the top of the motherboard. To know which panel to remove, look at the port
locations on the rear of the case. For example, in Figure 1-9, the ports on the motherboard are on the
left side of the case, indicating the bottom of the motherboard is on the left. Therefore, you will want
to remove the right panel to expose the top of the motherboard. Lay the case down to its left so the
ports and the motherboard are on the bottom. Later, depending on how drives are installed, it might
become necessary to remove the other side panel in order to remove the screws that hold the drives
in place.
Figure 1-9 Decide which side panel to remove
Motherboard is
mounted to this
side of the case
●● Locate the screws or clips that hold the side panel in place. Be careful not to unscrew any screws
besides these. The other screws probably are holding the power supply, fan, and other components in
place (see Figure 1-10). Place the screws in the cup or bag used for that purpose. Some cases use clips
on a side panel in addition to or instead of screws (see Figure 1-11).

6. Clip your ESD strap to the side of the computer case. To dissipate any charge between you and the
computer, put on your ESD strap if you have not already done so. Then clip the alligator clip on the strap
cable to the side of the computer case (see Figure 1-13).
Figure 1-12 Slide the panel to the rear of the case
Figure 1-13 Attach the alligator clip of your ground bracelet to the side of the
computer case
After you open a computer case, as shown in Figure 1-14, the main components you see inside are the power
supply, motherboard, expansion card, and drives installed in drive bays. You also see a lot of cables and wires
connecting various components. These cables are power cables from the power supply to various components, or
cables carrying data and instructions between components. The best way to know the purpose of a cable is to follow
it from its source to its destination.
●● After the screws are removed, slide the panel toward the rear, and then lift it off the case (see Figure 1-12).

Here is a quick explanation of the main components installed in the case, which are called internal components:
●● The motherboard, processor, and cooler. The motherboard—also called the main board, the system
board, or the techie jargon term, the mobo—is the largest and most important circuit board in the computer.
The motherboard contains a socket to hold the processor or CPU. The central processing unit (CPU), also
called the processor or microprocessor, does most of the processing of data and instructions for the entire
system. Because the CPU generates heat, a fan and heat sink might be installed on top to keep it cool. A
heat sink consists of metal fins that draw heat away from a component. The fan and heat sink together are
called the processor cooler. Figure 1-15 shows the top view of a motherboard, and Figure 1-16 shows the
ports on the side of a motherboard.

●● Expansion cards. A motherboard has expansion slots to be used by expansion cards. An expansion card,
also called an adapter card, is a circuit board that provides more ports than those provided by the motherboard. Figure 1-17 shows a video card that provides three video ports. Notice the cooling fan and heat sink
on the card, which help to keep the card from overheating. The trend today is for most ports in a system to
be provided by the motherboard (called onboard ports), with decreased use of expansion cards.

●● Memory modules. A desktop motherboard has memory slots, called DIMM (dual inline memory module)
slots, to hold memory modules. Figure 1-18 shows a memory module installed in one DIMM slot along with
three empty DIMM slots. Memory, also called RAM (random access memory), is temporary storage for data
and instructions as they are being processed by the CPU. The memory module shown in Figure 1-18 contains
several RAM chips. Video cards also contain some embedded RAM chips for video memory.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● The power supply. A computer power supply, also known as a power supply unit (PSU), is a box
installed in a corner of the computer case (see Figure 1-20) that receives and converts the house current so components inside the case can use it. Most power supplies have a dual-voltage selector
switch on the back of the computer case where you can switch the input voltage to the power
supply if necessary—115 V is used in the United States, and 220 V is used in other countries. See
Figure 1-21. The power cables can connect to and supply power to the motherboard, expansion cards,
and drives.
●● Hard drives and other drives. A system might have one or more hard drives and an optical drive. A hard
drive, also called a hard disk drive (HDD), is permanent storage used to hold data and programs. For
example, the Windows 10 operating system and applications are installed on the hard drive. All drives in a
system are installed in a stack of drive bays at the front of the case. The system shown in Figure 1-14 has
two hard drives and one optical drive installed. These three drives are also shown in Figure 1-19. The larger
hard drive is a magnetic drive, and the smaller hard drive is a solid-state drive (SSD). Each drive has two
connections for cables: The power cable connects to the power supply, and another cable, used for data
and instructions, connects to the motherboard.

Form Factors Used by Desktop Cases, Power Supplies, and Motherboards
The desktop computer case, power supply, and motherboard must all be compatible and fit together as an interconnecting system. The standards that describe the size, shape, screw hole positions, and major features of these
interconnected components are called form factors. Using a matching form factor for the motherboard, power
supply, and case assures you that
If you ever need to change the dual-voltage selector switch, be sure you first turn off the computer and unplug the
power supply.

●● The motherboard fits in the case.
●● The power supply cords to the motherboard provide the correct voltage, and the connectors match the
connections on the board.
●● The holes in the motherboard align with the holes in the case so you can anchor the board to the case. The
holes in the case align with ports coming off the motherboard.
●● For some form factors, wires for switches and lights on the front of the case match up with connections on
the motherboard.
●● The holes in the power supply align with holes in the case for anchoring the power supply to the case.
The two form factors used by most desktop and tower computer cases and power supplies are the ATX and
microATX form factors. Motherboards use these and other form factors that are compatible with ATX or microATX
power supplies and cases. You learn about other motherboard form factors in the module “All About Motherboards.”
Following are important details about ATX and microATX:
●● ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) is the most commonly used form factor today. It is an open, nonproprietary industry specification originally developed by Intel. An ATX power supply has a variety of
power connectors (see Figure 1-22). The power connectors are listed in Table 1-2, and several of them are
described next.

Connector Description
The 20-pin P1 connector is the main motherboard power connector used in the early
ATX systems.
The 24-pin P1 connector, also called the 2014-pin connector, is the main motherboard
power connector used today.
The 2014-pin P1 connector has four pins removed so the connector can fit into a
20-pin P1 motherboard connector.
The 4-pin 12 V connector is an auxiliary motherboard connector, which is used for
extra 12 V power to the processor.
The 8-pin 12 V connector is an auxiliary motherboard connector, which is used for
extra 12 V power to the processor, providing more power than the older 4-pin auxiliary
connector.
The 4-pin Molex connector is used for older IDE drives and some newer SATA drives,
and to provide extra power to video cards. It can provide 15 V and 112 V to the device.
The 15-pin SATA power connector is used for SATA (Serial ATA) drives. It can provide
13.3 V, 15 V, and 112 V, although 13.3 V is seldom used.
The PCIe 6-pin connector provides an extra 112 V for high-end video cards using PCI
Express.
The PCIe 8-pin connector provides an extra 112 V for high-end video cards using PCI
Express.
The PCIe 6/8-pin connector is used by high-end video cards using PCIe 316 slots to
provide extra voltage to the card; it can accommodate a 6-hole or 8-hole port. To make
the 8-pin connector, combine both the 6-pin and 2-pin connectors.

Power connectors have evolved because components that use new technologies require more power.
As you read about the following types of power connectors and why each came to be, you’ll also learn
about the evolving expansion slots and expansion
cards that drove the need for more power:
●● 4-pin and 8-pin auxiliary connectors. When processors began to require more power, the ATX Version 2.1
specifications added a 4-pin auxiliary connector near the processor socket to provide an additional 12 V
of power (see Figure 1-23). A power supply that provides this 4-pin 12 V power cord is called an ATX12V
power supply. Later boards replaced the 4-pin 12 V power connector with an 8-pin motherboard auxiliary
connector that provided more amps for the processor. See Figure 1-24.

motherboard with a power cord connected

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about each
connector listed in Table 1-2 and to know how to choose
a connector given a scenario.

●● 24-pin or 2014-pin P1 connector. The original P1 connector had 20 pins. Later, when faster PCI Express
(PCIe) slots were added to motherboards, more power was required and a new ATX specification (ATX
Version 2.2) allowed for a 24-pin P1 connector, also called the 2014 power connector.
All motherboards today use a 24-pin P1 connector. The extra four pins on the 24-pin P1 connector
provide 112 volts, 15 volts, and 13.3 volts. Figure 1-25 shows a 24-pin P1 power cord from the power
supply and a 24-pin P1 connector on a motherboard. Figure 1-26 shows the pinouts for the 24-pin power
cord connector, which is color-coded to wires from the power supply.

●● 6-pin and 8-pin PCIe connectors. Video cards draw the most power in a system, and ATX Version 2.2 provides
for power cables to connect directly to a video card and provide it more power than what comes through
the PCIe slot on the motherboard. The PCIe power connector might have six or eight pins. Figure 1-27 shows
a PCIe 316 video card. The edge connector has a break that fits the break in the slot. The tab at the end of
the edge connector fits into a retention mechanism at the end of the slot, which helps to stabilize a heavy
video card. The video card has a 6-pin connector on the end of the card. A PCIe 6-pin power cord from the
power supply plugs into the connector. The power supply connector is shown earlier in Table 1-2.

●● The microATX (mATX) form factor is a
major variation of ATX and addresses
some technologies that have emerged
since the original development of
ATX. MicroATX reduces the total cost
of a system by reducing the number of
expansion slots on the motherboard,
which in turn reduces the power supplied to the board and allows for a
smaller case size. A microATX motherboard (see Figure 1-28) will fit into
a case that follows the ATX 2.1 or
higher standard. A microATX power
supply uses a 24-pin P1 connector
and is not likely to have as many extra
wires and connectors as those on an
ATX power supply.

Now let’s learn about the expansion cards you might find installed inside a system.
Step 3: Removing Expansion Cards
Core 1 Objective 3.4
If you plan to remove several components, draw a diagram of all cable connections to the motherboard, expansion
cards, and drives. You might need this cable connection diagram to help you reassemble. Note where each cable
begins and ends, and pay particular attention to the small wires and connectors that connect the lights, switches,
and ports on the front of the case to the motherboard front panel connectors. It’s important to be careful about
diagramming these because it is easy to connect them in the wrong position later when you reassemble. You can
use a felt-tip marker to make a mark across components, which can indicate a cable connection, board placement,
motherboard orientation, speaker connection, brackets, and so on. Then you can simply line up the marks when
you reassemble. This method, however, probably won’t work for the front case wires because they are so small. For
these, consider writing down the colors of the wires and their positions on the pins or taking a photo of the wires
in their positions with your cell phone (see Figure 1-29).
Figure 1-29 Diagram the pin locations of the color-coded
wires that connect to the front of the case
A header is a connector on a motherboard that consists of pins that stick up from the board. For example, the group
of pins shown in Figure 1-29 is called the front panel header.
Note 3
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to recognize and know the more important features of the ATX and microATX form
factors used by power supplies. Given a scenario, you should be able to identify and choose the appropriate form factor.
Computer systems vary in so many ways that it’s impossible to list the exact order to disassemble one. Most
likely, however, you need to remove the expansion cards first. Do the following to remove the expansion cards:
1. Remove any wire or cable connected to the card.
2. Remove the screw holding the card to the case (see Figure 1-30).

3. Grasp the card with both hands, and remove it by lifting straight up. If you have trouble removing it from
the expansion slot, you can very slightly rock the card from end to end (not side to side). Rocking the
card from side to side might spread the slot opening and weaken the connection.
4. As you remove the card, don’t put your fingers on the edge connectors or touch a chip, and don’t stack
the cards on top of one another. Lay each card aside on a flat surface, preferably in an antistatic bag.
Figure 1-30 Remove the screw holding the expansion card to the case
Cards installed in PCI Express 3 16 slots use a latch that helps to hold the card securely in the slot. To remove these
cards, use one finger to hold the latch back from the slot, as shown in Figure 1-31, as you pull the card up and out of
the slot.

Step 4: Removing the Motherboard
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Depending on the system, you might need to remove the motherboard or the drives next. My choice is to first remove
the motherboard. It and the processor are the most expensive and most easily damaged parts of the system. I like
to get them out of harm’s way before working with the drives. However, in some cases, you must remove the drives
or the power supply before you can get to the motherboard. Study your situation and decide which to do first. To
remove the motherboard, do the following:
1. Unplug the power supply lines to the motherboard.
2. Unplug SATA cables connected to the motherboard.
3. Disconnect the wires leading from the front or top of the computer case to the motherboard; these wires
are called the front panel connectors. If you don’t have the motherboard manual handy, be very careful to
diagram how these wires connect because they are rarely labeled well on a motherboard. Make a careful
diagram, and then disconnect the wires. Figure 1-32 shows five leads and the pins on the motherboard
front panel header that receive these leads. The pins are color-coded and cryptically labeled on the board.
Figure 1-32 Five leads from the front panel connect to two rows of
pins on the motherboard front panel header
4. Disconnect any other cables or wires connected to the motherboard. A case fan might be getting power
by a small wire connected to the motherboard. In addition, USB ports on the front of the computer case
might be connected by a cable to the motherboard.
5. You’re now ready to remove the screws that hold the motherboard to the case. A motherboard is
installed so that the bottom of the board does not touch the case. If the fine traces or lines on the
bottom of the board were to touch the case, a short would result when the system runs again. To keep
the board from touching the case, screw holes are elevated using spacers, also called standoffs, which
are round plastic or metal pegs that separate the board from the case. Carefully pop off these spacers
and/or remove the screws (up to nine) that hold the board to the case (see Figure 1-33) and then remove
the board. Set it aside in a safe place.

POST Diagnostic Cards
When supporting a motherboard, a POST diagnostic card, also called a POST card or motherboard test card, can be
of great help in discovering and reporting computer errors and conflicts that occur after you first turn on a computer
but before the operating system (such as Windows 10) is launched. To understand what a POST card does, you need
to know about the firmware—the programs and data stored on the motherboard.
Caution
Never lift a motherboard by the cooler because doing so might create an air gap between the cooler and the processor,
which can cause the processor to overheat later.
Caution
Some processors have heavy or bulky cooling assemblies installed on top of them. For these systems, it is best to
remove the cooler before you take the motherboard out of the case because the motherboard is not designed to support the heavy cooler when the motherboard is not securely seated in the case. Removal of the cooler is covered in the
module “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory.”
6. The motherboard should now be free, and you can carefully remove it from the case, as shown in Figure 1-35.
Lift the board by its edges, as shown in the figure.
When you’re replacing a motherboard that is not the same size as the original board in a case, you can use needle-nose
pliers to unplug a standoff so you can move it to a new hole.

A POST card is not essential, but it can be quite useful. The POST (power-on self-test) is a series of tests performed by the startup BIOS/UEFI when you first turn on a computer. These tests determine if the startup BIOS/
UEFI can communicate correctly with essential hardware components required for a successful boot. If you have a
problem that prevents the computer from booting and that you suspect is related to hardware, you can install the
POST card in an expansion slot on the motherboard. For laptops, some cards install in a USB port. You can then
attempt to boot. The card monitors the boot process and reports errors, usually as coded numbers on a small LED
panel on the card. You then look up the number online or in the documentation that accompanies the card to get
more information about the error and its source. Figure 1-37 shows a POST diagnostic card, the Post Code Master
card by Microsystems Developments, Inc.
Figure 1-36 This firmware chip contains BIOS/UEFI, flash ROM, and CMOS RAM; CMOS RAM is powered
by the coin battery located near the chip
Coin battery
Firmware chip
Firmware consists of the older BIOS (basic input/output system) firmware and the newer UEFI (Unified
Extensible Firmware Interface) firmware and is usually referred to as BIOS or UEFI. Figure 1-36 shows an embedded firmware chip on a motherboard that contains the BIOS/UEFI programs. BIOS/UEFI is responsible for managing
essential devices (for example, keyboard, mouse, hard drive, and monitor) before the OS is launched, starting the
computer, and managing motherboard settings. A feature of the newer UEFI is that it can manage a secure boot,
assuring that no rogue malware or operating system hijacks the system during the boot.

Before purchasing this or any other diagnostic tools or software, read the documentation about what they can
and cannot do, and read some online product reviews. Try using google.com and searching on “computer diagnostic
card reviews.”
Some Dell computers have lights on the case that blink in patterns to indicate a problem early in the boot before the
OS loads. These blinking lights give information similar to that given by POST cards.
Note 6
Step 5: Removing the Power Supply
Core 1 Objective 3.5
To remove the power supply from the case, look for screws that attach the power supply to the computer case,
as shown in Figure 1-38. Be careful not to remove any screws that hold the power supply housing together. You do
not want to take the housing apart. After you have removed the screws, the power supply still might not be free.
Sometimes, it is attached to the underside of the case by recessed slots. Turn the case over, and look on the bottom
for these slots. If they are present, determine in which direction you need to slide the power supply to free it from
the case.

Figure 1-38 Remove the power supply mounting screws
Power Supply Tester
A power supply tester is used to measure the output of each connector coming from the power supply. You can test
the power supply when it is outside or inside the case. As you saw earlier in Figure 1-20, the power supply provides
several cables and connectors that power various components inside the computer case. A power supply tester has
plugs for each type of cable. Connect a power cable to the tester, plug up the power supply, and turn on the tester.
An LCD panel reports the output of each lead (see Figure 1-39).

Step 6: Removing the Drives
Core 1 Objective 3.3
A computer might have one or more hard drives, an optical drive (CD, DVD, or Blu-ray), or some other type of
drive. A drive receives power by a power cable from the power supply and communicates instructions and data
through a cable attached to the motherboard. Most hard drives and optical drives today use the serial ATA (SATA)
standard.
Figure 1-41 shows a SATA cable connecting a hard drive and motherboard. SATA cables can only connect to a
SATA connector on the motherboard in one direction (see Figure 1-42). SATA drives get their power from a power
cable that connects to the drive using a SATA power connector (refer back to the photo in Table 1-2).
Multimeter
A multimeter (see Figure 1-40) is a more general-purpose tool that can measure several characteristics of electricity in a variety of devices. Some multimeters can measure voltage, current, resistance, and continuity. (Continuity
determines that two ends of a cable or fuse are connected without interruption.) When set to measure voltage,
you can use it to measure output of each pin on a power supply connector. When set to measure continuity, a
multimeter is useful to test fuses, to determine if a cable is good, or to match pins on one end of a cable to pins
on the other end.

Remove each drive next, handling them with care. Here are some tips:
●● Some drives have one or two screws on each side of the drive that attach the drive to the drive bay. After
you remove the screws, the drive slides to the front or to the rear and then out of the case.
●● Sometimes, there is a catch underneath the drive that you must lift up as you slide the drive forward.
●● Some drive bays have a clipping mechanism to hold the drive in the bay. First release the clip, and then
pull the drive forward and out of the bay (see Figure 1-43). Handle the drives with care. Some drives have
an exposed circuit board on the bottom of the drive. Don’t touch this board.
Figure 1-43 To remove this optical drive, first release the clip to release
the drive from the bay
Figure 1-44 Some cases require you to remove the front panel before
removing the optical drive
●● Some drives must be removed through the front of the case, especially optical drives. After removing all
screws or releasing the clipping mechanism, you might need to remove the front panel of the case to remove
the drive. See Figure 1-44.

then the drives are removed from the bay. To remove the bay, first remove the screws or release the clip
holding the bay in place, and then slide the bay out of the case. The drives are usually installed in the bay
with two screws on each side of each drive. Remove the screws and then the drives (see Figure 1-46).

Steps to Put a Computer Back Together
Core 1 Objective 3.4
To reassemble a computer, reverse the process of disassembling. Here is where your diagrams will be especially
useful; having the screws and cables organized will also help. In the directions that follow, we’re also considering
the possibility that you are installing a replacement part as you reassemble the system. Do the following:
1. Install components in the case in this order: power supply, drives, motherboard, and cards. When installing
drives, know that for some systems, it’s easier to connect data cables to the drives and then slide the
drives into the bay. If the drive is anchored to the bay with screws or latches, be careful to align the front of
the drive flush with the front of the case before installing screws or pushing in the latches (see Figure 1-47).

2. Place the motherboard inside the case. Make sure the ports stick out of the I/O shield at the rear of the
case and the screw holes line up with screw holes on the bottom of the case. Figure 1-48 shows how you
must align the screw holes on the motherboard with those in the case. There should be at least six screw
sets, and there might be as many as nine. Use as many screws as there are holes in the motherboard.

3. Connect the power cords from the power supply to the motherboard. A system will always need the main
P1 power connector and most likely will need the 4-pin auxiliary connector for the processor. Other power
connectors might be needed depending on the devices you later install in the system. Here are the details:
●● Connect the P1 power connector from the power supply to the motherboard (refer back to Figure 1-25).
●● Connect the 4-pin or 8-pin auxiliary power cord from the power supply to the motherboard, as shown
in Figure 1-49. This cord supplies the supplemental power required for the processor.
Figure 1-49 The auxiliary 4-pin power cord provides power to
the processor
●● To power the case fan, connect the power cord from the fan to pins on the motherboard labeled
Fan Header. Alternately, some case fans use a 4-pin Molex connector that connects to a power cable
coming directly from the power supply.
●● If a CPU and cooler are already installed on the motherboard, connect the power cord from the CPU
fan to the pins on the motherboard labeled CPU Fan Header.
4. Connect the wire leads from the front panel of the case to the front panel header on the motherboard.
These are the wires for the switches, lights, and ports on the front or top of the computer. Because your
case and your motherboard might not have been made by the same manufacturer, you need to pay close
attention to the source of the wires to determine where they connect on the motherboard. For example,
Figure 1-50 shows a computer case that has seven connectors from the front panel that connect to
the motherboard. Figure 1-51 shows the front panel header on the motherboard for these lights and
switches. If you look closely at the board in Figure 1-51, you can see labels identifying the pins.
The five smaller connectors on the right side of Figure 1-50 are labeled from right to left as follows:
●● Power SW. Controls power to the motherboard; must be connected for the PC to power up
●● HDD LED. Controls the drive activity light on the front panel that lights up when any SATA or IDE
device is in use (HDD stands for hard disk drive and LED stands for light-emitting diode; an LED is a
light on the front panel.)
●● Power LED1. Controls the power light and indicates that power is on
●● Power LED2. Controls the power light; the two positive and negative leads indicate that power is on
●● Reset SW. Switch used to reboot the computer

To help orient the larger connectors on the motherboard pins, look for a small triangle embedded on
the connector that marks one of the outside wires as pin 1 (see Figure 1-50). Look for pin 1 to be labeled
on the motherboard as a small 1 embedded to either the right or left of the group of pins. If the labels on
the board are not clear, turn to the motherboard user guide for help. The diagram in Figure 1-52 shows
what you can expect from one motherboard user guide. Notice pin 1 is identified as a square pin in the
diagram, rather than round like the other pins.
Positive wires connecting the front panel to the motherboard are usually a solid color, and negative wires are usually
white or striped.

5. Connect wires to ports on the front panel of the case. Depending on your motherboard and case,
there might be cables to connect audio ports or USB ports on the front of the case to headers on the
motherboard. Audio and USB connectors are the two left connectors, previously shown in Figure 1-50.
You can see these ports for audio and USB on the front of the case in Figure 1-54. Look in the motherboard
documentation for the location of these connectors. The audio and USB connectors are labeled for one
board in Figures 1-55A and 1-55B.

6. Install the video card and any other expansion cards. Push the card straight down into the slot, being
careful not to rock it side to side, and install the screw to secure the card to the case.
7. Take a few minutes to double-check each connection and make sure it is correct and snug. Verify that all
required power cords are connected correctly and that the video card is seated solidly in its slot. Also
verify that no wires or cables are obstructing fans. You can use cable ties to keep wires out of the way.
8. Plug in the keyboard, monitor, and mouse.
9. In a classroom environment, have the instructor check your work before you close the case and power up.
10. Turn on the power, and check that the PC is working properly. If the PC does not work, the problem is
most likely a loose connection. Just turn off the power, and recheck each cable connection and each
expansion card. You probably have not solidly seated a card in the slot. After you have double-checked,
try again.

Now step back and congratulate yourself on a job well done! By taking a computer apart and putting it back
together, you’ve learned how computer parts interconnect and work.
Now let’s turn our attention to how to disassemble and reassemble a laptop.
First Look at Laptop Components
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 1.3
A laptop, also called a notebook, is designed for portability (see Figures 1-56A and 1-56B) and can be just as powerful
as a desktop computer. Nearly 75 percent of personal computers purchased today are laptops, and that percentage
is growing. Laptops use the same technology as desktops, but with modifications to use less power, take up less
space, and operate on the move.
Laptops come in several varieties, including some with a touch screen that allows you to handwrite on it with a
stylus and some with a rotating or removable screen that allows you to use the laptop as a tablet (see Figure 1-57).
Another variation of a laptop is a netbook (Figure 1-56B), which is smaller and less expensive than a laptop and
has fewer features. An all-in-one computer (Figure 1-56C) has the monitor and computer case built together and
uses components that are common to both a laptop and desktop. Because all-in-one computers use many laptop
components and are serviced in similar ways, we include them in this part of the module.

A laptop provides ports on its sides, back, or front for connecting peripherals (see Figure 1-58). Ports common
to laptops as well as desktop systems include USB, network, and audio ports (for a microphone, headset, or external
speakers). Video ports might include one or more VGA, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt (on Apple laptops), or HDMI ports
to connect to a projector, second monitor, or television. On the side or back of the laptop, you’ll see a DC jack to
receive power from the AC adapter. A laptop may also have an optical drive, but netbooks usually don’t have them.
Notice the two slots in Figure 1-58 used for flash memory cards: a MagicGate slot and an SD card slot. Each can
support several types of flash memory cards, which you learn about later in the text.

When a laptop is missing a port or slot you need, you can usually find a USB dongle to provide the port or slot.
Here are some possible solutions for a missing or failed port:
●● Connect to a local wired network. Figure 1-59 shows a USB to RJ-45 dongle. Plug the dongle into a USB port,
and plug a network cable into the RJ-45 port the dongle provides to connect the laptop to a wired network. Kensington Technology Group

●● Connect to a local wireless network.
Figure 1-60 shows a USB to Wi-Fi
dongle, which allows you to connect
a laptop that doesn’t have wireless
capability to a wireless network or
when the laptop’s wireless component
has failed. Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is
the common name for standards for
a local wireless network.
●● Connect to a cellular network. Some
laptops have embedded capability to connect to a cellular network.
Figure  1-61 shows a USB cellular
modem that can be used for a laptop
that doesn’t have the embedded technology. A cellular network consists of
geographic areas of coverage called
cells, each controlled by a tower
called a base station. Cell phones are
so named because they use a cellular
network.
●● Connect to a Bluetooth device. When a laptop doesn’t have Bluetooth capability, you can use a USB to
Bluetooth adapter to connect to a Bluetooth wireless device such as a Bluetooth printer, headphones, or
smartphone. Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology to connect two devices in a small personal
network.
●● Use an external optical drive. When a laptop or netbook doesn’t have an optical drive, you can use a USB
optical drive. Plug the USB optical drive into a USB port so you can use CDs and DVDs with the laptop or
netbook.

A port replicator, sometimes called a universal docking station, is a device that provides ports to allow a laptop to easily connect to peripheral devices, such as an external monitor, network, printer, keyboard and mouse, or
speakers. See Figure 1-64. Some port replicators also supply power to the laptop to charge the battery. The difference
between a port replicator and a docking station is that a port replicator isn’t proprietary to a single brand or model
of laptop because it typically connects to a laptop using a single USB port.
Docking Stations and Port Replicators
Core 1 Objective 1.3
The bottom or sides of some laptops have a proprietary connector, called a docking port (see Figure 1-62), that
connects to a docking station. A docking station provides ports to allow a laptop to easily connect to a full-sized
monitor, keyboard, AC power adapter, and other peripheral devices. See Figure 1-63. Laptop manufacturers usually
offer a docking station as an additional option on most business laptops and a few consumer laptops as well. A
disadvantage of a docking station is that when you upgrade your laptop, you typically must purchase a new compatible docking station.

To use a docking station or port replicator, plug all the peripherals into the docking station or port replicator.
Then connect your laptop to the station. No software needs to be installed. When you need to travel with your
laptop, you don’t have to unplug all the peripherals; all you have to do is disconnect the laptop from the docking
station or port replicator.
Special Considerations When Supporting Laptops
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 1.3
Laptops and their replacement parts cost more than desktop computers with similar features because laptop components are designed to be more compact and stand up to movement. Laptops use compact hard drives, small
memory modules, and CPUs that require less power than regular components. Whereas a desktop computer is often
assembled from parts made by a variety of manufacturers, laptop computers are almost always sold by a vendor
that either manufactured the laptop or had it manufactured as a consolidated system. Notable factors that generally
apply more to laptop than desktop computers include the following:
●● The original equipment manufacturer’s warranty
●● The service manuals and diagnostic software provided by the manufacturer
●● The customized installation of the OS that is unique to laptops
●● The need to order replacement parts directly from the laptop manufacturer or other source authorized by
the manufacturer
In many situations, the tasks of maintaining, upgrading, and troubleshooting a laptop require the same skills,
knowledge, and procedures as when servicing a desktop computer. However, you should take some special considerations into account when supporting, upgrading, and troubleshooting laptops. The same concerns apply to
netbooks and all-in-one computers. Let’s begin with warranty concerns.
Warranty Concerns
Most laptop manufacturers or retailers offer at least a one-year warranty and the option to purchase an extended
warranty. If problems arise while the laptop is under warranty, you only have to deal with a single manufacturer or
retailer to get support or parts. After the laptop is out of warranty, this manufacturer or retailer can still be your
one-stop shop for support and parts.
Caution
The warranty often applies to all components in the system, but it can be voided if someone other than an authorized
service center representative services the laptop. Therefore, you as a service technician must be very careful not to
void a warranty that the customer has purchased. Warranties can be voided by opening the case, removing part labels,
installing other-vendor parts, upgrading the OS, or disassembling the system unless directly instructed to do so by
authorized service center personnel.

Table 1-3 Laptop, Netbook, and All-in-One Manufacturers
Before you begin servicing a laptop, avoid potential problems with a warranty by always asking the customer, “Is
the laptop under warranty?” If the laptop is under warranty, look at the documentation to find out how to get technical support. Options are online chat sessions, phone numbers, and email. Use the most appropriate option. Before
you contact technical support, have the laptop model and serial number ready (see Figure 1-65). You’ll also need the
name, phone number, and address of the person or company that made the purchase. Consider asking the customer
for a copy of the receipt and warranty so you’ll have the information you need to talk with support personnel.
Figure 1-65 The model and serial number stamped on the bottom of a laptop are
used to identify the laptop to service desk personnel
Based on the type of warranty purchased by the laptop’s owner, the manufacturer might send an on-site service
technician, ask you to ship or take the laptop to an authorized service center, or help you solve the problem by an
online chat session or over the phone. Table 1-3 lists some popular manufacturers of laptops, netbooks, and allin-ones. Manufacturers of laptops typically also produce all-in-ones because of the features they have in common.

Service Manuals and Other Sources of Information
Desktop computer cases tend to be similar to one another, and components in desktop systems are usually interchangeable among manufacturers. Not so with laptops. Laptop manufacturers typically take great liberty in creating
their own unique computer cases, buses, cables, connectors, drives, circuit boards, fans, and even screws, all of
which are likely to be proprietary in design.
Every laptop model has a unique case. Components are installed in unique ways, and opening the case for each
laptop model is done differently. Because of these differences, servicing laptops can be very complicated, tedious,
and time consuming. For example, a hard drive on one laptop is accessed by popping open a side panel and sliding
the drive out of its bay. However, to access the hard drive on another model of laptop, you must remove the keyboard. If you are not familiar with a particular laptop model, you can damage the case frame or plastics as you pry
and push while trying to open it. Using trial and error is likely to damage a case. Even though you might successfully
replace a broken component, the damaged case will result in an unhappy customer.
Fortunately, a laptop service manual can save you considerable time and effort—if you can locate one online (see
Figure 1-66). Most laptop manufacturers closely guard these service manuals and release them only to authorized
service centers. Two laptop manufacturers, Lenovo and Dell, provide their service manuals online free of charge.
ASUS and HP also do an excellent job of offering online support.
Figure 1-66 Download the laptop service manual to learn how to use
diagnostic tools, troubleshoot a laptop, and replace components

For example, Figure 1-67 shows a screenshot from a video that walks through the steps to replace the top cover on
an HP laptop. I applaud Lenovo, Dell, and HP for their generous documentation about how their laptops are disassembled and for the options they provide for purchasing proprietary parts without first being an authorized service center.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
For all laptop manufacturers, check the Support or FAQ pages of their websites for help with tasks such as opening a case without damaging it and locating and replacing a component. Be aware that some manufacturers offer
almost no help at all. Sometimes, you can find service manuals online. To find your manual, search on the laptop
model—for example, search on “Lenovo ThinkPad L15 Gen 2 laptop service manual.”
Don’t forget about the user manuals. They might contain directions for upgrading and replacing components that
do not require disassembling the case, such as how to upgrade memory or install a new hard drive. User manuals
also include troubleshooting tips and procedures and possibly descriptions of BIOS/UEFI settings. In addition, you
can use a web search engine to search on the computer model, component, or error message, which might give you
information about the problem and solution.
Diagnostic Tools Provided by Manufacturers
Most laptop manufacturers provide diagnostic software that can help you test components to determine which component needs replacing. As one of the first steps when servicing a laptop, check the user manual, service manual,
or manufacturer’s website to determine if diagnostic software exists and how to use it. Use the software to pinpoint
the problem component, which can then be replaced.
Check the manufacturer’s website for diagnostics software that can be downloaded for a specific model of
laptop or stored on the hard drive or on CDs bundled with the laptop. Figure 1-68 shows a window provided by the
diagnostics program installed on the hard drive of one laptop.
The wiki-type website ifixit.com does an excellent job of providing its own teardown and reassembly instructions for
many brands and models of laptops. You can also buy parts and tools on the site.
Videos at youtube.com can also help teach you how to disassemble a specific model of laptop. However, be aware
that not all videos posted on YouTube follow recommended best practices.

One example of diagnostic software is PC-Doctor
(pc-doctor.com), which is recommended by some manufacturers. The diagnostic software is stored on the hard
drive or on CD. If stored on CD, you can boot from the
CD to run the tests. If the software is stored on the hard
drive, you can run it from the Windows Start menu or
by pressing a function key at startup before Windows
loads. Either way, PC-Doctor can run tests on the keyboard, video, speakers, touch pad, optical drive, wireless LAN, motherboard, processor, ports, hard drive, and
memory. To learn how to use the software, see the laptop’s service manual or user manual. You can find a standalone version of PC-Doctor for DOS and PC-Doctor for Windows at pc-doctor.com. You can purchase it at this site; it’s
expensive but might be worth it if you plan to service many laptops.
Working Inside a Laptop Computer
Core 1 Objective 1.1
Sometimes it is necessary to open a laptop case so you can upgrade memory, exchange a hard drive, or replace a
failed component such as the keyboard, Mini PCIe card, or wireless card. Most laptops sold today are designed so
that you can easily purchase and exchange memory modules or hard drives. However, replacing a failing processor
or motherboard can be a complex process, taking several hours. Most often, you will choose to replace the entire
laptop rather than doing these labor-intensive and costly repairs.
When you purchase a replacement part for a laptop from
the laptop’s manufacturer, most often the manufacturer
also sends detailed instructions for exchanging the part
and/or phone support to talk you through the process.

Screws and nuts on a laptop are smaller than those on a desktop system, requiring smaller tools. Figure 1-69
shows several tools used to disassemble a laptop, although you can get by without several of them. Here’s the list:
●● ESD strap
●● Small flathead screwdriver
●● Number 1 Phillips-head screwdriver
●● Metal and plastic spudgers in various sizes (useful for prying open casings without damaging plastic connectors and cases, such as the one in Figure 1-67)
●● Dental picks and tweezers (useful for prying without damaging plastic cases, connectors, and screw covers,
such as the one in Figure 1-70)

Figure 1-71 To protect the system against ESD, attach the alligator clip
of a ground strap to an I/O port on the back of the laptop
Working on laptops requires extra patience. As with desktop systems, before opening the case of a laptop or
touching sensitive components, you should always wear an ESD strap to protect the system against ESD. You can
attach the alligator clip end of the strap to an unpainted metallic surface on the laptop. This surface could be, for
instance, a port on the back of the laptop (see Figure 1-71). If a ground strap is not available, first dissipate any ESD
between you and the laptop by touching a metallic, unpainted part of it, such as a port on the back, before you
touch a component inside the case.
Figure 1-72 Using a notepad can help you organize
screws so you know which screw goes
where when reassembling
Laptops contain many small screws of various sizes and lengths. When reassembling the system, put screws back where they came from so
you won’t use screws that are too long and that
can protrude into a sensitive component and damage it. As you remove a screw, store or label it so
you know where it goes when reassembling. One
method is to place screws in a pillbox with each
compartment labeled. Another way is to place
screws on a soft, padded work surface and use
white labeling tape to label each set of screws. A
third way to organize screws is to put them on
notebook paper and write beside them where
the screw belongs (see Figure 1-72). My favorite
method of keeping up with all these screws is to
tape each one beside the manufacturer documentation that I’m following to disassemble the laptop
(see Figure 1-73). Whatever method you use, work
methodically to keep screws and components
organized so you know what goes where when
reassembling.

If you disassemble a computer and are not following directions from a service manual, keep notes as you work to
help you reassemble later. Draw diagrams and label things carefully. Include cable orientations and screw locations
in your drawings. You might consider using a digital camera. Photos taken at each step in the disassembly process
will be a great help when it’s time to put the laptop back together.
When disassembling a laptop, consider the following tips:
●● Make your best effort to find the hardware service manual for the particular laptop model you are servicing.
The manual should include all the detailed steps to disassemble the laptop and a parts list of components
that can be ordered from the laptop manufacturer. If you don’t have this manual, your chances of successfully replacing an internal component are greatly reduced! Another helpful resource is searching the Internet
for video tutorials for the teardown of the model you are using. If you don’t have much experience disassembling a laptop, it isn’t wise to attempt to do so without the service manual.
●● Consider the warranty that might still apply to the laptop. Remember that opening the case of a laptop under
warranty most likely will void the warranty.
●● Make certain that any component you have purchased to replace an internal component will work in the
model of laptop you are servicing.
●● Take your time. Patience is needed to keep from scratching or marring plastic screw covers, hinges, and
the case.
●● As you work, don’t force anything. If you do, you’re likely to break it.
●● Always wear an ESD strap or use other protection against ESD.
●● When removing cables, know that some ribbon cable connectors are ZIF connectors, which stands for
zero insertion force. To disconnect a cable from a ZIF connector, first lift up the connector’s lever and then
easily remove the cable, as shown in Figure 1-74. Figure 1-75 shows a laptop that uses three ZIF connectors
to hold the three keyboard cables in place. For some ribbon cables, you simply pull the cable out of the
connector. For these cables, it’s best to use two tweezers, one on each side of the connector, to remove
the cable.
Figure 1-73 Tape screws beside the step in the manufacturer
documentation that told you to remove the screw
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know the importance of keeping parts organized when disassembling a laptop as
well as the importance of having manufacturer documentation to know the steps for disassembly. Given a scenario,
you should be able to adhere to appropriate procedures.

●● Again, use a spudger, dental pick, or very small screwdriver to pry up a plastic cover hiding a screw.
●● Some laptops use plastic screws that are intended to be used only once. The service manual will tell you
to be careful not to overtighten these screws and to always use new screws when reassembling a laptop.
●● Disassemble the laptop by removing each field replaceable unit (FRU) in the order given by the laptop’s
service manual.
●● At some point in the disassembly process after all appropriate covers and screws have been removed, you
must crack the case, which means you separate the top and bottom parts of the case. The parts might be
tightly sealed together. To separate them, use a plastic or metal spudger to slide along the seal and pry open
the case, as shown earlier in Figure 1-67.
When reassembling a laptop, consider these general tips:
●● Reassemble the laptop in the reverse order you disassembled it. Follow each step carefully.
●● Be sure to tighten, but not overtighten, all screws. Loose screws or metal fragments in a laptop can be dangerous; they might cause a short as they shift about inside the laptop.

locking bar to release the latch, and then remove the cable
using the pull tab, which is blue on this laptop

●● Before you install the battery or AC adapter, verify that there are no loose parts inside the laptop. Pick it
up and gently shake it. If you hear anything loose, open the case, find the loose component, screw, spring,
or metal flake, and fix the problem.
Exploring Laptop Internal Components
Core 1 Objective 1.1
Here is a list of important components you are likely to be instructed to remove when disassembling a laptop and
the typical order you remove them. However, know that the components and the order of disassembly vary from
one laptop to another:
1. Remove or disable the battery pack. To start the disassembly, disconnect all peripherals, remove
discs from the optical drive, and shut down the system. Then, disconnect the AC adapter and remove
the battery. Removing the battery (see Figure 1-76) assures you that no power is getting to the system,
which keeps the laptop and you safe as you work. Some laptops and netbooks have built-in batteries.
For these devices, follow the manufacturer instructions to disable the battery (often called Ship Mode),
which prevents it from providing power to any component.
Figure 1-76 Remove the battery pack before opening a laptop case

2. Remove the hard drive. For Figure 1-77 Remove all screws that secure the hard drive in its bay
some laptops, the hard drive
is accessed by removing the
hard drive compartment
cover from the bottom of
the laptop. For example,
Figure 1-77 shows the hard
drive is secured in its bay with
screws. When you remove the
screws and disconnect the
ribbon cable, you can lift the
drive from its bay. For other
hard drives, you unplug the
drive from its drive socket
rather than disconnecting a
ribbon cable from the drive.

3. Remove memory. Laptops use smaller memory modules than the DIMMs used in desktop computers.
Figure 1-78 shows a DIMM and a SO-DIMM (small outline DIMM) for size comparison. For one laptop,
you first remove the memory/Mini PCI Express Card compartment cover to access the memory modules.
Release two latches on both edges of the socket at the same time to remove the memory modules, as
shown in Figure 1-79.
Figure 1-78 A DIMM used in desktops compared with a SO-DIMM used in laptops

Figure 1-79 Release the latches on both edges of the socket to remove
the memory modules
4. Remove the wireless card. For the laptop in Figure 1-79, the Mini PCI Express wireless card is installed
in the same compartment as the memory modules. Disconnect the two wires leading to the wireless
antennas, which are located in the laptop lid. Next, remove the screw securing the wireless card, then
pull the card directly away from the socket, as shown in Figure 1-80.

5. Remove the optical drive. The optical drive is secured by a single screw on the bottom of the laptop.
After you remove the single screw holding the drive in place, slide the drive out of the case. See
Figure 1-81.
Figure 1-80 Pull the wireless card directly away from the socket to
prevent damage to the card and socket
Figure 1-81 Slide the optical drive out of the case after removing the
screw securing the optical drive to the laptop
6. Crack the case. After removing compartment covers and the components accessible inside these
compartments (for example, memory, optical drive, and hard drive), you are ready to remove any other
screws as directed in the service manual, and then you can crack the case. Use a spudger to slide along
the seal between the case top and bottom, and pry open the plastic casing on the side, as shown in
Figure 1-82.

Other hardware components you are likely to find in a laptop case include the system board, CPU, heat sink,
fan, and the LCD panel and components in the laptop lid.
Exploring Inside an All-in-One Computer
Core 1 Objective 1.1
An all-in-one computer uses a mix of components sized for a desktop computer and a laptop. Let’s get the general
idea of what’s inside the case of an all-in-one by looking inside the Lenovo ThinkCentre all-in-one, which was shown
earlier in Figure 1-56. Figure 1-84 shows the computer with the case cover removed. Notice that, in the figure, the hard
drive is a 3.5-inch drive appropriate for a desktop system, and the memory modules are SO-DIMMs appropriate for
a laptop. So goes the hybrid nature of an all-in-one. The fan and heat sink look more like that of a laptop computer,
but the processor socket on the motherboard is a desktop processor socket, another hybrid design.
Figure 1-82 Using a spudger helps prevent harming the casing
when prying it open
Figure 1-83 Disconnect both the touch pad board cable and the
keyboard cable to remove the keyboard
7. Remove the keyboard bezel. The keyboard bezel is the keyboard casing surrounding the keyboard of a
laptop. For some laptops, such as the one shown in Figure 1-83, the keyboard bezel is the top of the case.
For other laptops, you remove the case top and then remove the keyboard. Once you remove screws
and disconnect the cables from the motherboard, the keyboard bezel should easily lift away from the
laptop, as shown in Figure 1-83. You might need a spudger to help.

To work inside an all-in-one, you’ll need the service manual to know how to open the case and replace internal
components. Replacements for some components, such as the motherboard and power supply, must be purchased
from the all-in-one manufacturer because they are likely to be proprietary, as with many laptop components. For
specific directions about replacing parts in an all-in-one, see the service manual.
Now that you are familiar with some major components of a laptop, let’s learn some special considerations
when maintaining laptops.
Maintaining Laptops
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 1.3
Laptops and mobile devices tend not to last as long as desktop computers because they are portable and therefore
subject to more wear and tear. A device’s user manual gives specific instructions on how to care for the device.
Those instructions follow these general guidelines:
●● LCD panels on devices are fragile and can be damaged fairly easily. Take precautions against damaging a
laptop or other device’s LCD panel. Don’t touch it with sharp objects like ballpoint pens.
●● Don’t pick up or hold a laptop by the lid. Pick it up and hold it by the bottom. Keep the lid closed when the
laptop is not in use.
●● Only use battery packs and AC adapters recommended by the laptop manufacturer. Keep the battery pack
away from moisture or heat, and don’t attempt to take the pack apart. When it no longer works, dispose of it
correctly. For laptops, you might consider buying an extra battery pack to use when the first one discharges.
You can also buy battery chargers so that you can charge one while the other is in use.
●● Don’t tightly pack a laptop or tablet in a suitcase because the LCD panel might get damaged. Use a goodquality carrying case, and make a habit of always transporting the laptop in the carrying case. Don’t place
heavy objects on top of the laptop case.
●● Don’t move the laptop while the hard drive is being accessed (when the drive indicator light is on). Wait
until the light goes off.
●● Don’t put the laptop close to an appliance such as a TV, large audio speakers, or refrigerator that generates
a strong magnetic field, and don’t place your cell phone on a laptop while the phone is in use.
●● Always use passwords to protect access to your laptop so you are better protected when connected to a
public network or if the device is stolen or used by an unauthorized person.
●● Keep your laptop or device at room temperature. For example, never leave it in a car overnight during cold
weather, and don’t leave it in a car during the day in hot weather. Don’t expose your laptop or device to
direct sunlight for an extended time.
●● Don’t leave the laptop or device in a dusty or smoke-filled area. Don’t use it in a wet area such as near a
swimming pool or in the bathtub. Don’t use it at the beach where sand can get in it.
●● Don’t power it up and down unnecessarily.
●● Protect the laptop from overheating by not running it when it’s still inside the carrying case, not resting
it on a pillow, and not partially covering it with a blanket or anything else that would prevent proper air
circulation around it.
●● If a laptop has just been brought indoors from the cold, don’t turn it on until it reaches room temperature.
In some cases, condensation can cause problems. Some manufacturers recommend that when you receive
a new laptop shipped to you during the winter, you should leave it in its shipping carton for several hours
before you open the carton to prevent subjecting the laptop to a temperature shock.
●● Protect a laptop against static electricity. If you have just come in from the cold on a low-humidity day
when there is the possibility that you are carrying static electricity, don’t touch the laptop until you have
grounded yourself.
●● Before placing a laptop in a carrying case for travel, remove any CDs, DVDs, or USB flash drives, and put
them in protective covers. Verify that the system is powered down and not in sleep mode, which will drain
the battery.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● If a laptop gets wet, you can partially disassemble it to allow internal components to dry. Give the laptop
several days to dry before attempting to turn it on. Don’t use heat to speed up the drying time.
●● Keep current backups of important data on a laptop or device in case it fails or is stolen.
A well-used laptop, especially one that is used in dusty or dirty areas, needs cleaning occasionally. Here are
some cleaning tips:
1. Clean the LCD panel with a soft, dry cloth. If the panel is very dirty, you can use monitor wipes or lightly
dampened cloths to clean it. Some manufacturers recommend using a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and
water to clean an LCD panel. Be sure the LCD panel is dry before you close the lid.
2. Use a can of compressed air meant for use on computer equipment to blow dust and small particles out
of the keyboard, trackball, and touch pad. Turn the laptop at an angle and direct the air into the sides of
the keyboard. Then use a soft, damp cloth to clean the key caps and touch pad.
3. Use compressed air to blow out all air vents on the laptop to make sure they are clean and unobstructed.
4. If a laptop is overheating, the CPU fan might be clogged with dust. The overheating problem might be
solved by disassembling the laptop and blowing out the fan with compressed air.
5. If keys are sticking, remove the keyboard so you can better spray under the keys with compressed air. If
you can remove the key cap, remove it and clean the key contact area with contact cleaner. One example
of a contact cleaner you can use for this purpose is Stabilant 22 (stabilant.com). Reinstall the keyboard
and test it. If the key still sticks, replace the keyboard.
6. Remove the battery and clean the battery connections with a contact cleaner.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to solve the problem of sticking keys on a laptop, given a scenario.
Module Summary
Exploring a Desktop Computer
●● When hardware support technicians disassemble or reassemble a computer, they need to stay organized,
keep careful notes, and follow all the safety procedures to protect the computer equipment and themselves.
●● Before opening a computer case, shut down the system, unplug it, disconnect all cables, and press the power
button to drain residual power.
●● Common tools for a computer hardware technician include an ESD strap, screwdrivers, tweezers, flashlight,
compressed air, and cleaning solutions and pads.
●● Special tools a hardware technician might need include a POST diagnostic card, power supply tester, multimeter, and loopback plugs.
●● A computer’s video ports might include the VGA, DVI, DisplayPort, and HDMI ports. Other ports include RJ-45,
audio, SPDIF, USB, eSATA, PS/2, serial, and RJ-11 ports. A Thunderbolt port can transmit video, data, and power.
●● Internal computer components include the motherboard, processor, expansion cards, DIMM memory modules, hard drive, optical drive, and power supply.
●● Cases, power supplies, and motherboards use ATX and microATX form factors. The form factor determines
how the case, power supply, and motherboard fit together and the cable connectors and other standards
used by each.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Power connectors used by the ATX and microATX form factors include the older 20-pin P1, current 24-pin
P1, 4-pin and 8-pin CPU auxiliary motherboard, 4-pin Molex, 15-pin SATA, and 6/8-pin PCIe connectors.
●● An expansion card fits in a slot on the motherboard and is anchored to the case by a single screw or clip.
●● Firmware consists of the older BIOS (basic input/output system) firmware and the newer UEFI (Unified
Extensible Firmware Interface) firmware. This BIOS/UEFI firmware is responsible for managing essential
devices (for example, keyboard, mouse, hard drive, and monitor) before the OS is launched, starting the
computer, and managing motherboard settings.
●● Most hard drives and optical drives today use the serial ATA (SATA) standards for the drive to interface with
the motherboard and power supply.
First Look at Laptop Components
●● Laptop computers are designed for travel. They use the same technology as desktop computers, with modifications for space, portability, and power conservation. A laptop generally costs more than a desktop with
comparable power and features.
●● A laptop docking station or port replicator can make it easy to connect and disconnect peripheral devices.
●● You can use the USB ports for expansion—for example, you can add a USB to RJ-45 dongle, a USB to Wi-Fi
dongle, Bluetooth capability, or a USB optical drive.
●● The laptop manufacturer documentation—including the service manual, diagnostic software, and recovery
media—is useful when disassembling, troubleshooting, and repairing a laptop.
●● Field replaceable units (FRUs) in a laptop can include the memory modules, hard drive, keyboard, Mini PCIe
card, and wireless card.
●● When an internal component needs replacing, consider the possibility of disabling the component and using
an external peripheral device in its place. Don’t jeopardize the warranty on a laptop by opening the case or
using components not authorized by the manufacturer.
●● Replacing the laptop might be more cost effective than performing labor-intensive repairs, such as replacing the system board.
●● When disassembling a laptop, the manufacturer’s service manual is essential.
●● When upgrading components on a laptop, including memory, use components that are the same brand as
the laptop, or use only components recommended by the laptop’s manufacturer.
●● Follow the directions in a service manual to disassemble a laptop. Keep small screws organized as you
disassemble a laptop because they come in a variety of sizes and lengths. Some manufacturers use plastic
screws and recommend you use new screws rather than reuse the old ones.
●● Special concerns when supporting a laptop also apply to supporting a netbook or all-in-one computer.
●● When replacing an FRU, you might need to remove internal laptop components such as the keyboard, hard
drive, memory, wireless card, and battery pack.
●● An all-in-one computer uses a combination of components designed for desktop computers and laptops.

Identifying Connectors Used on an Installed Motherboard
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.4
If necessary, remove the case cover to your desktop computer. Next, remove the expansion cards from your system.
With the expansion cards out of the way, you can more clearly see the power cables and other cables and cords
connected to the motherboard. Diagrams and notes are extremely useful when disassembling and reassembling a
system. To practice this skill, draw a large rectangle that represents the motherboard. On the rectangle, label every
header or connector that is used on the board. Note on the label the type of cable that is used and where the other
end of the cable connects.
Hands-On Project 1-2
Identifying Drives and Their Connectors
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objectives: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4
If your instructor has provided a display of drives, identify the purpose of each drive (for example, a hard drive or
optical drive) and the type of power connector each drive uses (for example, SATA or Molex). If you have access to
a computer with the case cover removed, complete the following:
1. List the drives installed, the purpose of each drive, and the type of interface and power connector it uses.
2. How many connectors does the motherboard have for drives? Identify each type of connector.
Hands-On Project 1-3
on the front of the case to discharge residual power. Carefully open the case. Remember not to touch anything
inside the case unless you are using an ESD strap or antistatic gloves to protect components against ESD.
Draw a diagram of the inside of the case, and label all drives, the motherboard, the cooler, DIMM memory
modules, the power supply, and any expansion cards installed. Then do the following:
1. Write down how many power cables are coming from the power supply. How many of these cables are
connected to the motherboard? To other devices inside the computer? Identify each type of power cable the
system is using.
2. For the motherboard, list the number and type of expansion slots on the board. Does the board have a
20-pin or 24-pin P1 connector? What other power connectors are on the board? How many memory slots
does the board have? Locate the screws that attach the motherboard to the case. How many screws are
used? Do you see screw holes in the motherboard that are not being used? As a general rule of thumb, up
to nine screws can be used to attach a motherboard to a case.
3. For expansion cards, examine the ports on the back of the card. Can you determine the purpose of the card
by looking at its ports? What type of slot does the card use?
Leave the case open so you’ll be ready for Hands-On Project 1-2 next.

Closing the Case
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.4
The case cover to your desktop computer is off from doing the previous exercises. Before you close your case, it’s
always a good idea to quickly clean it first. Using a can of compressed air, blow the dust away from fans and other
components inside the case. Be careful not to touch components unless you are properly grounded. When you’re
done, close the case cover.
Hands-On Project 1-4
Observing Laptop Features
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 1.1
Do the following to find a service manual for a laptop you have available, such as one that belongs to you or a friend:
1. What are the brand, model, and serial number of the laptop?
2. What is the website of the laptop manufacturer? Print or save a webpage on that site that shows the
documentation and/or drivers available for this laptop.
3. If the website provides a service manual for disassembling the laptop, download the manual. Print two or
three pages from the manual showing the title page and table of contents for the manual.
4. If the website does not provide a service manual, search the Internet for the manual. If you find it, download
it, and print the title page and table of contents.
After examining a laptop, its documentation, and the manufacturer’s website, complete the following:
1. What ports are on the laptop?
2. What type of memory slots does the laptop have?
3. List the steps you would take to upgrade memory.
4. What is the cost of a new battery pack?

Setting Up a Service Center for Laptops
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 1.1
If you intend to set up your own computer repair shop, you might want to consider becoming a service center for a few
brands of the more popular laptops. Reasons to become an authorized service center include having access to service
manuals, parts lists, and wholesale parts for laptops. Do the following to research becoming an authorized service center:
1. Select a brand of laptops that you think you would like to service.
2. Research the website of this manufacturer, and answer these questions:
a. Where is the closest authorized service center for this brand of laptops?
b. What are the requirements to become an authorized service center? Print or save the webpage
showing the requirements.
c. Is A1 certification one of those requirements?
d. Some laptop manufacturers offer a program that falls short of becoming an authorized service center
but does provide support for IT professionals so that repair technicians can order laptop parts. Does
the manufacturer offer this service? If so, what must you do to qualify?
If you try one brand of laptop and can’t find the information you need, try another brand. Sometimes this
information can only be obtained by contacting the manufacturer directly. And one more hint: To use google.com to
search a particular site, begin the search string with site:hostname.com, for example, site:microsoft.com.
Real Problem 1-2
Taking Apart a Laptop
Est. Time: 1 hour
Core 1 Objective: 1.1
If you enjoy putting together thousand-piece jigsaw puzzles, you’ll probably enjoy working on laptop computers. With
desktop systems, replacing a component is not a time-consuming task, but with laptops, the job could take half a
day. If you take the time to carefully examine the laptop’s case before attempting to open it, you will probably find
markings provided by the manufacturer to assist you in locating components that are commonly upgraded. If you
have a service manual, your work will be much easier than without one.
The best way to learn how to disassemble a laptop is to practice on an old one that you can afford to break.
Find an old Dell, Lenovo, or IBM ThinkPad for which you can download the service manual from the appropriate
website. Carefully and patiently follow the disassembly instructions and then reassemble the laptop. Write down
the challenges you faced while disassembling and reassembling the laptop. What might you do to overcome these
challenges next time? When done, you can congratulate yourself and move on to newer laptops.
Real Problem 1-3
Print or save the webpages that show each tool and its price. What is the total cost of this set of tools? If you
were building your own computer repair toolkit, which tools would you purchase first if you could not afford the
entire set of tools? Which tools not listed would you add to your toolbox?

Introduction
In the module “Taking a Computer Apart and Putting It Back Together,” you learned how to work inside a desktop or
laptop computer and began the process of learning about each major component or subsystem in a computer case.
In this module, you build on that knowledge to learn about motherboards, which techies sometimes call the mobo.
You’ll learn about motherboard sizes (called form factors), connectors, expansion slots, sockets, onboard ports,
and chipsets. Then you’ll learn how to support a motherboard, which includes configuring, maintaining, installing,
and replacing it.
A motherboard is considered a field replaceable unit, so it’s important to know how to replace one, but the
good news is you don’t need to know how to repair one that is broken. Troubleshooting a motherboard works hand
in hand with troubleshooting the processor and other components that must work to boot up a computer, so we’ll
leave troubleshooting the motherboard until later modules.
Motherboard Types and Features
Core 1 Objectives 3.1, 3.4
A motherboard is the most complicated component in a computer. When you put together a computer from parts,
generally you start by deciding which processor and motherboard you will use considering the purpose of the
computer. Everything else follows these two decisions. Take a look at the details of Figure 2-1, which shows a

microATX motherboard, the ASUS Prime Z590-Plus, that can hold various Intel Core, Pentium, and Celeron processors
in the LGA1200 11th and 10th generation processor socket. When selecting a motherboard, generally you need to pay
attention to the form factor, processor socket, chipset, expansion slots, and other connectors, slots, and ports. In
this section of the module, we look at the details of each of these features so you can read a technical motherboard
ad with the knowledge of a pro and know how to select the right motherboard when replacing an existing one or
building a new system.
Motherboard Form Factors
Core 1 Objective 3.4
The motherboard form factor determines the size of the board and its features that make it compatible with power
supplies and cases. The most popular motherboard form factors are ATX, microATX (a smaller version of ATX, sometimes called the mATX), Extended ATX (E-ATX) (a larger version of ATX), and Mini-ITX, also called mITX (a smaller
version of microATX). Figure 2-2 shows an ATX board. You saw a microATX motherboard in Figure 2-1. A Mini-ITX
board is shown in Figure 2-3. The Mini-ITX board is also commonly referred to as an ITX board.

Intel and AMD Chipsets and Processor Sockets
Core 1 Objective 3.4
A chipset is a set of chips on the motherboard that works closely with the processor to collectively control the
memory, buses on the motherboard, and some peripherals. The chipset must be compatible with the processor it
serves. A socket is rectangular with pins or pads to connect the processor to the motherboard and a mechanism to
hold the processor in place. This chipset and socket determine which processors a board can support.
The two major chipset and processor manufacturers are Intel (intel.com) and AMD (amd.com). Intel dominates
the chipset market for several reasons. It knows more about its own Intel processors than other manufacturers do,
and it produces the chipsets most compatible with the Intel family of processors. However, AMD’s market share is
currently about 20 percent and growing.
Intel Chipsets
Intel makes desktop, mobile, and server chipsets and processors. To see a complete comparison chart of all Intel
chipsets and processors, start at the Intel webpage ark.intel.com. Intel groups its chipsets and processors in generations, and each generation has a code name. Here is the list of generations from the past several years:
●● 600 Series Desktop Chipsets. The latest Intel chipsets are the 600 Series Chipsets, used with the LGA1700
socket, also called Socket V. The 600 Series Chipsets are compatible with the 12th generation (formally
called Alder Lake) desktop processors. Thus far, the only chipset in this family is the Z690 chipset, which
was released at the end of 2021. The current 12th generation processors include the Core i5, Core i7, and
Core i9 processors; these processors can have up to 10 cores.
●● 400 and 500 Series Desktop Chipsets. The 400 and 500 Series Chipsets are used with the LGA1200 socket
and are compatible with the 10th and 11th generation desktop processors. Some motherboards based on
the 400 Series Chipset may need a BIOS/UEFI update to support the 11th generation of processors, also
called Rocket Lake, which were released in March 2021. The 11th generation started a new development

cycle based on the new Cypress Cove microarchitecture. The 11th generation offers increased performance
in speed, memory, and graphics in an attempt to win back some of the market from AMD, specifically in the
gaming market. The 10th generation of chipsets and processors, also called Comet Lake, was announced in
2019. The 10th generation increased cores, speed, and memory support over earlier generations.
●● 300 Series Desktop Chipsets. The 300 Series Chipsets are used with the altered pinout of the LGA1151
socket and are compatible with the 9th and 8th generation of processors. The 9th generation of processors,
also called Coffee Lake Refresh, was introduced in late 2018 and was defined by adjusting the integrated
heat spreader and increasing the core counts. The 9th generation was discontinued at the end of 2021.
The 8th generation of chipsets and processors, also called Coffee Lake, began shipping at the end of 2017.
The 8th generation was discontinued in 2021. A close-up of this open socket is shown in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-5 The 8th generation LGA1151 socket with the cover removed
and load plate lifted, ready to receive the processor
●● 200 Series Desktop Chipsets. The 200 Series Chipsets are used with the original version of the LGA1151
socket and are compatible with the 7th and 6th generation desktop processors. The 7th generation processors, also called Kaby Lake, began shipping in 2016, and mobile processors were launched in 2017. The 7th
generation was discontinued in 2020. The 6th generation processors, also called Skylake, were launched in
2015. Even though the 6th generation processors and chipsets were discontinued in 2020, they are the base
architecture that the next several generations optimize.
Since the release of the 2nd generation Intel Core family of processors, you can identify which generation a
processor fits in by the four or five digits in the model number. The first of the four digits is the generation. For
example, the Core i5-9600K processor is a 9th generation processor, and the Core i5-11500 processor is an 11th
generation processor.
Sockets for Intel Processors
The Intel name for a socket includes the number of pins the socket has. Intel uses a land grid array (LGA) for all its
current sockets. These sockets have blunt pins that project up to connect with lands on the bottom of the processor.
You can see these lands when you look closely at Figure 2-5.
Here are the current Intel sockets for desktop computers:
●● The LGA1700 socket (also called Socket V) was released in 2021 and is compatible with 12th generation
(Alder Lake) processors. Because this socket is larger than previous sockets, heat sinks and coolers that
worked with previous sockets won’t work with the LGA1700 socket.
●● The LGA1200 socket was released in 2020. This socket is compatible with Intel’s 10th and 11th generation
processors and chipsets and is shown in Figure 2-6. This socket design offers improved power delivery and
support for I/O features.

●● The LGA1151 socket was first released in 2015. The first release of the socket works with Intel’s 6th and 7th
generation processors and chipsets and is shown in Figure 2-7. The second release works with Intel 8th and
9th generation processors and chipsets.

Here are the Intel sockets used in servers and high-performance workstations:
●● The LGA2066 socket is used with 8th through 6th generation processors and chipsets. It was introduced
with Skylake-X high-end 6th generation processors in 2017.
●● LGA2011 is used with 5th through 2nd generation processors and chipsets and has several variations for
different generations, including LGA2011-0, LGA2011-1, and LGA2011-v3.
Caution
When a processor is installed in a socket, extreme care must be taken to protect the socket and the processor against
ESD and from damage caused by bending the pins or scratching the processor pads during the installation. Take care
not to touch the bottom of the processor or the pins of the socket. Doing so can leave finger oil on the gold plating of
the contact surfaces. This oil can later cause tarnishing and lead to a poor contact.
To ensure that even force is applied when inserting the processor in the socket, sockets have one or two levers
on the sides. These sockets are called zero insertion force (ZIF) sockets, and the levers are used to lift the processor
up and out of the socket. When you push the levers down, the processor moves into its pin connectors with equal
force over the entire housing. Because the socket and processor are delicate, processors generally should not be
removed or replaced repeatedly.
AMD Chipsets and Sockets
Currently, AMD has four chipset and socket categories for personal computers:
●● Figure 2-8 shows the sTRX4 socket, a land grid array (LGA) socket that supports 3rd generation Threadripper
processors and uses the TRX40 chipset. The sTRX4 socket was released in 2019. The Threadripper processors are part of the AMD Ryzen series of high-end processors.

●● The TR4 (Threadripper 4) socket, released in 2017, is an LGA socket that supports Threadripper processors
and uses the AMD X399 chipset.
●● The AM4 chipset family and AM4 socket are used with AMD Ryzen and Athlon processors. While the
AM4 socket was launched in 2016, it is still a highly popular socket. AMD chipsets in the AM4 family include
A300, B300, and X300. The processors and chipsets support mainstream desktop systems. The socket has
1331 pins in a pin grid array (PGA), which means the socket has 1331 holes and the AMD processor
has 1331 pins that fit into those socket holes. AMD has announced that in 2022, the Ryzen processors will
use a new socket and chipset to replace the popular AM4 socket and chipset.
●● The AM31 and AM3 are PGA sockets used with AMD Piledriver and Bulldozer processors and the 9 series
chipsets, including 970, 980G, and 990X. The processors and chipsets are used in high-end gaming systems.
AM31 and AM3 processors can fit in either socket. Figure 2-9 shows the AM31 socket and the bottom of
the AMD FX processor.
Figure 2-9 The AMD AM31 open socket; notice the holes in the
socket and pins on the bottom of the processor
●● The FM21 is an older PGA socket used with AMD Athlon, Steamroller, and Excavator processors and A-series
chipsets such as the A58 and A68H.
Match a Processor to the Socket and Motherboard
For both Intel and AMD, the processor families (for example, Intel Core i3, Intel Core i5, AMD Athlon, or AMD Ryzen)
are used with various chipset generations and sockets. Therefore, you must pay close attention to the actual model
number of the processor to know which socket it requires and which motherboards can support it. If you install a
processor on a motherboard that can fit the socket but has the wrong chipset for the processor, you can damage
both the motherboard and the processor. Sometimes, you can install a newer processor on an older motherboard
by first updating the firmware on the motherboard, which you learn to do later in this module. To match a processor to a motherboard and socket:
●● Look at the motherboard manufacturer’s website or user guide for a list of processors the motherboard
supports. If a motherboard requires a firmware update to use a newer processor, the motherboard manufacturer’s website will alert you and provide the downloaded firmware update. Updating chipset firmware
is covered later in this module. If an update is required, you must update the firmware before you install
the new processor.
●● You can also search the Intel (ark.intel.com) or AMD (amd.com) website for the exact processor to make
sure the socket it uses is the same as the socket on the motherboard. You can also use the website to find
other information about the processor.

Buses and Expansion Slots
Core 1 Objectives 3.1, 3.4
When you look carefully at a motherboard, you may see many fine lines on both the top and the bottom of the board’s
surface (see Figure 2-10). These lines, sometimes called traces, are circuits or paths that enable data, instructions,
timing signals, and power to move from component to component on the board. This system of pathways used for
communication and the protocol and methods used for transmission are collectively called a bus. (A protocol is a
set of rules and standards that any two entities use for communication.)
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam does not expect you to be familiar with the processor sockets used by laptop computers. It is
generally more cost effective to replace a laptop that has a damaged processor than to replace the processor. If you
are called on to replace a laptop processor, however, always use a processor the laptop manufacturer recommends
for the particular laptop model and system board CPU socket.
Figure 2-10 On the bottom of the motherboard, you can see bus lines
terminating at the processor socket
The specifications of a motherboard always include the expansion slots on the board. Take a look at a motherboard ad that shows detailed specifications, and identify the types of expansion slots on the board. Table 2-2 lists
the various expansion slots found on today’s motherboards.

The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about the various PCI, PCIe, and SATA slots and how to select add-on cards
to use them. You also need to know how to install external USB devices and how to use the internal USB headers on
a motherboard.
Now let’s look at the details of the PCIe and PCI expansion slots used in desktops.
PCI Express
PCI Express (PCIe) currently comes in four different slot sizes called PCI Express 31 (pronounced “by one”), 34, 38,
and 316. Figure 2-11 shows three of these slots. Notice in the figure the sizes of the slots and the positions of the
notches in the slots, which prevent a card from being inserted in the wrong direction or in the wrong slot.

Two PCIe ×1 slots
Two PCIe ×16 slots
Two PCI slots
A PCIe 31 slot contains a single lane for data. PCIe 34 has four lanes, PCIe 38 has eight lanes, and PCIe 316 has
16. The more lanes an add-on card uses, the more data is transmitted in a given time. Data is transferred over one,
four, eight, or 16 lanes, which means that a 16-lane slot is faster than a shorter slot when the add-on card in the slot
is using all 16 lanes. If you install a short card in a long slot, the card uses only the lanes it connects to. PCIe is used
by a variety of add-on cards. The PCIe 316 slot is used by graphics cards that require large throughput.
Less expensive motherboards may not have a full PCIe 316 bus and yet provide PCIe 316 slots. The longer cards
can fit in the 316 slot but only use four lanes for data transfers. The version of PCIe also matters; the latest currently
available is Version 5, which is the fastest. (Version 6 is expected to be released in 2022.) Learn to read motherboard
ads carefully. For example, look at the ad snippet shown in Figure 2-12. One of the longer PCIe 316 slots operates in
34 mode, only using four lanes, and uses the PCIe Version 2 standard. If you were to install a graphics card in one
of these two PCIe 316 slots, you would want to be sure you install it in the faster of the two 316 slots.
A graphics card that uses a PCIe 316 slot may require as much as 450 watts. A typical PCIe 316 slot provides
75 watts to a card installed in it. To provide the extra wattage for the card, a motherboard may have power connectors near the 316 slot, and the graphics card may have one, two, or even three connectors to connect the card
to the extra power (see Figure 2-13). Possibilities for these connectors are a 6-pin PCIe (which provides 75 watts)

and/or an 8-pin PCIe connector (which
provides 150 watts), a 4-pin Molex connector, or a SATA-style connector. Connect power cords from the power supply
to the power connector type you find
on the graphics card. Alternately, some
motherboards provide Molex or SATA
power connectors on the board to power
PCIe graphics cards. See Figure 2-14.
When installing a graphics card, always
follow the manufacturer’s directions for
connecting auxiliary power for the card.
If the card requires extra wattage, the
package will include power cords you
need for the installation.

Core to Core
PCI
Conventional PCI slots and buses are slower than those of PCI Express. The slots are slightly taller than PCIe slots
(look carefully at the two PCI slots labeled in Figure 2-11); they are positioned slightly closer to the rear of the computer case, and the notch in the slot is near the front of the slot. The PCI bus transports 32 data bits in parallel and
operates at about 500 Mbps. The PCI slots are used for all types of add-on cards, such as Ethernet network cards,
wireless cards, and sound cards. Although most graphics cards use PCIe, you can buy PCI video cards to use if your
PCIe slots are not working.
Onboard Ports and Connectors
In addition to expansion slots, a motherboard might also have several ports and internal connectors. Ports coming
directly off the motherboard are called onboard ports or integrated components. For external ports, the motherboard provides an I/O panel of ports that stick out the rear of the case. These ports may include multiple USB ports,
PS/2 mouse and keyboard ports, video ports (HDMI, DVI-D, DVI-I, or DisplayPort), sound ports, a LAN RJ-45 port (to
connect to the network), and an eSATA port (for external SATA drives). Figure 2-15 shows ports on an entry-level
desktop motherboard.

Figure 2-16 The I/O shield fits the motherboard ports to the computer case
When you purchase a motherboard, the package includes an I/O shield, which is the plate you install in the
computer case that provides holes for the I/O ports. The I/O shield is the size designed for the case’s form factor,
and the holes in the shield are positioned for the motherboard ports (see Figure 2-16).
A motherboard might have several internal connectors, including USB, M.2, SATA, and PCIe connectors. When
you purchase a motherboard, look in the package for the motherboard manual, which is either printed or on DVD;
you can also find the manual online at the manufacturer’s website. The manual will show a diagram of the board
with a description of each connector. For example, the connectors for the motherboard in Figure 2-17 are labeled
as the manual describes them. If a connector is a group of pins sticking up on the board, the connector is called a
header. You will learn to use most of these connectors in later modules.

Next is a rundown of the internal connectors you need to know about.
SATA
SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment or Serial ATA), pronounced “say-ta,” is an interface standard used
mostly by storage devices. To attach a SATA drive to a motherboard, you need a data connection to the motherboard
and a power connection to the power supply. Figure 2-18 shows a motherboard with seven SATA connectors. Six use
the SATA Revision 3 standard, and one is a shorter SATA Express connector.

The following are currently used versions of SATA:
●● SATA Express (SATAe) combines SATA and PCIe to provide a faster bus than SATA Revision 3, although the
standard is seldom used.
●● SATA Revision 3.x (third generation) is commonly known by its throughput as SATA 6Gb/s.
●● SATA Revision 2.x (second generation) is commonly known by its throughput as SATA 3Gb/s.

SAS
SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) is an interface standard used mostly by storage devices—typically in servers and workstations—and the successor of SCSI. SAS is significantly more expensive, more durable, and faster than SATA. SAS
is well suited for a server setting where many users will be accessing the data at the same time. SAS-4 is the most
current version of SAS, completed in 2017, and has speeds up to 22.5 Gb/s. If a motherboard does not have any SAS
ports or needs more, you can use an
expansion card with SAS ports.
M.2
The M.2 connector, formally known
as the Next Generation Form Factor
(NGFF), uses the PCIe, USB, or SATA
interface to connect a mini add-on
card. The card fits flat against the
motherboard and is secured with a
single screw. Figure 2-19 shows the
slot and three screws for M.2 cards.
The three screws allow for the installation of cards of three different
lengths.
The M.2 connector or slot was
first used on laptops and is now common on desktop motherboards. It is
commonly used by wireless cards
and solid-state drives (SSDs). When the PCIe
interface is used, the slot is faster than all the
SATA standards normally used by hard drives;
therefore, the M.2 slot is often the choice to support the SSD that will hold the Windows installation. However, before installing Windows on an
M.2 drive, make sure the motherboard BIOS/UEFI
firmware will boot from an M.2 device. (Look for
the option in the boot priority order in BIOS/UEFI
setup, which is discussed later in this module.)
Some motherboards have a cover over an M.2
slot. Figure 2-20 shows documentation in the
motherboard’s user manual with instructions on
how to remove this cover to install the M.2 card.
Be aware there are multiple M.2 standards
and M.2 slots. An M.2 slot is keyed for certain
M.2 cards by matching keys on the slot with
notches on the card. Figure 2-21 shows three
popular options, although other options exist.
Before purchasing an M.2 card, make sure the
card matches the M.2 slot and uses an interface
standard the slot supports. For example, for one
motherboard, the M.2 slot uses either the PCIe or
SATA interface. When a card that uses the SATA
interface is installed in the slot, the motherboard
uses SATA for the M.2 interface and disables one
of the SATA connectors. When a PCIe M.2 card is
installed, the motherboard uses the PCIe interface for the slot.

USB
A motherboard may have USB headers or USB connectors. (Recall that a header is a connector with pins sticking
up.) The USB header is used to connect a cable from the motherboard to USB ports on the front of the computer
case (see Figure 2-22).

Finding the Motherboard Documentation
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.4
The motherboard manual or user guide is essential to identifying components on a board and knowing how to
support the board. This guide may be found at a web address printed on a card that came bundled with the motherboard. If you don’t have the direct web address, you can search the motherboard manufacturer’s support website
for the user guide.
To find the correct user guide online, you need to know the board manufacturer and model. If a motherboard
is already installed in a computer, you can use BIOS/UEFI setup or the Windows System Information utility (msinfo32.exe)
to report the brand and model of the board. To access System Information for Windows, enter msinfo32.exe
in the search box. In the System Information window, click System Summary. In the System Summary information
in the right pane, look for the motherboard information labeled as the System Manufacturer and System Model or
BaseBoard Manufacturer and BaseBoard Product (see Figure 2-23).

Using BIOS/UEFI Setup to Configure
a Motherboard
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Firmware on the motherboard is used to enable or disable a connector, port, or component; control the frequency
and other features of the CPU; manage security features; control what happens when the computer first boots; and
monitor and log various activities of the board.
Motherboards made after 2012 use BIOS/UEFI firmware; prior to 2012, all motherboards used BIOS firmware.
UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) improves on BIOS but includes BIOS for backward compatibility with
older devices. UEFI is managed by several manufacturers and developers under the UEFI Forum (see uefi.org).
Facts you need to know about UEFI include the following:
●● Microsoft requires UEFI in order for a system to be certified for Windows 10.
●● UEFI is required for hard drives larger than 2 TB. (One terabyte, or TB, equals 1000 gigabytes, or GB.)
A hard drive uses one of two methods for partitioning the drive: The Master Boot Record (MBR) method
is older, allows for four partitions, and is limited to 2 TB drives. The GUID Partition Table (GPT) method is
newer, allows for any size of hard drive, and, for Windows, can have up to 128 partitions on the drive. GPT
is required for drives larger than 2 TB or for systems that boot using UEFI firmware.
●● UEFI offers Secure Boot, which prevents a system from booting up with drivers or an OS not digitally signed
and trusted by the motherboard or computer manufacturer. For Secure Boot to work, the OS must support
UEFI. Microsoft requires Secure Boot be enabled for a system to install Windows 11.
●● For backward compatibility, UEFI can boot from an MBR hard drive and provide a BIOS boot through its
Compatibility Support Module (CSM) feature. CSM is backward compatible with devices and drivers that
use BIOS.
The motherboard settings don’t normally need to be changed except, for example, when you are first setting up
the system, when there is a problem with hardware or the OS, or when a power-saving feature or security feature
(such as a power-on password) needs to be disabled or enabled.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about BIOS/UEFI settings for boot options, firmware updates, security settings, and interface configurations. Security settings include passwords, drive encryption, the TPM chip, HSM, and
Secure Boot. All these settings and features are covered in this section of the module. In a given scenario, you need
to know which BIOS/UEFI setting to use to solve a problem, install a new component or feature, or secure a system.
Accessing the BIOS/UEFI Setup Program
Core 1 Objective 3.4
You access the BIOS/UEFI setup program by pressing a key or combination of keys during the boot process; for
some laptops, you press a button on the side of the laptop. For most motherboards, you press F12, F2, or Del during
the boot. Sometimes, a message such as Press F12 or Del to enter UEFI BIOS Setup appears near the beginning of the
boot, or a boot menu with the option to access BIOS setup appears after you have pressed a special button. See the
motherboard documentation to know for sure which key or button to press.
When you press the appropriate key or button, a setup screen appears with menus and Help features that are
often very user-friendly. Although the exact menus depend on the BIOS/UEFI maker, the sample screens shown in
the following section will help you become familiar with the general contents of BIOS/UEFI setup screens.

BIOS firmware uses only the keyboard for input, whereas UEFI firmware can use the keyboard and mouse. Some
manufacturers use BIOS firmware with integrated UEFI functionality, and the setup screens are controlled only by the
keyboard.
Note 1
Viewing and Monitoring Information
Core 1 Objective 3.4
The first screen you see in the firmware utility usually gives you information about the system, including the BIOS/UEFI
version and information about the CPU, memory, hard drive, optical drive, date, and time. BIOS/UEFI menus and screens
differ, so you might need to browse through the screens to find what you’re looking for. For example, Figure 2-25 shows
information on the Configuration screen about installed hard drives and optical drives. This system has five internal SATA and eSATA ports and one external eSATA port. As you can see, a 120 GB hard drive is installed on SATA
port 0, and another 1000 GB hard drive is installed on SATA port 1. Both ports are internal SATA connectors on
the motherboard. Notice the optical drive is installed on SATA port 3, which is also an internal connector on the
motherboard.
Figure 2-25 A BIOS/UEFI setup screen showing a list of drives installed on the system
Source: Intel
Figure 2-26 shows the BIOS/UEFI screen for another system with a graphical BIOS/UEFI interface. Notice
information about the BIOS version, CPU type, total memory installed, current temperature and voltage of the
CPU, how the two memory slots on the motherboard are used (one is populated and one is empty), and RPMs
of CPU fans.
When you click Advanced Mode, you see the SATA configuration. For example, Figure 2-27 shows a 1000 GB
hard drive using the first SATA6G yellow port and a DVD device using the second SATA3G brown port. The other
SATA ports are disabled. Also notice in the figure that S.M.A.R.T. is enabled. S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis
and Reporting Technology) monitors statistics reported by a hard drive and can predict when the drive is likely to
fail. It displays a warning when it suspects a failure is about to happen.

Changing Boot Options
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Figure 2-28 shows an example of a boot menu in BIOS/UEFI setup. Here, you can set the order in which the system
tries to boot from certain devices (called the boot priority order or boot sequence).
Figure 2-28 Set the boot priority order in BIOS setup
Source: Intel
Boot Priority Order
Here are some examples of when you might want to change the boot priority order:
●● Some distributions of the Linux operating system (OS) can be installed on a USB flash drive; you can boot
the OS from this drive when you put the USB device first in the boot priority order.
Caution
Booting the system directly from a USB flash drive causes the system to ignore any OS that might be installed on the
hard drive, which can be a security issue because data stored on the hard drive might be vulnerable. To help close this
security hole, set the boot priority order to first boot from the hard drive, and password-protect access to BIOS/UEFI
setup so others cannot change the boot order. Other ways to protect the OS and data on the hard drive are addressed
later in this text.
Some computers with multiple USB ports limit the capability to boot to only a single USB port.
Note 2
●● When you first install an OS on the hard drive, you might want BIOS/UEFI to first boot from a DVD so you
can install Windows from the Windows setup DVD.
●● If you are installing the OS from a server on the network, put the PCI LAN: EFI Network option at the top of the
boot priority order, and enable PXE Boot to LAN. This causes the computer to boot to the firmware program
called the Preboot eXecution Environment or Pre-Execution Environment (PXE), which then searches the
network for an OS it receives from a deployment server. Notice in Figure 2-28 that when booting to access
a deployment server on the network, you must choose whether your network is using IPv4 or IPv6 for IP
addressing. You learn more about these concepts later in the text.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● When Windows is installed on the hard drive but refuses to start, you can boot from the Windows setup
DVD to troubleshoot and repair the installation.
After the OS is installed, you can prevent accidental or malicious boots from a DVD or other removable media
by changing the boot priority order to boot first from the hard drive. Also, BIOS/UEFI screens might give you options
regarding built-in diagnostics that occur at the boot. You can configure some motherboards to perform a fast boot
and bypass the extensive POST. When troubleshooting a boot problem, be sure to set BIOS/UEFI to perform the full
POST.
Manage Secure Boot
You also need to know how to manage Secure Boot, which was invented to help prevent malware from launching
before the OS and anti-malware software are launched. Secure Boot works only when the boot mode is UEFI (and
not CSM) and the OS supports it. Windows 10 and several distributions of Linux (for example, Ubuntu and Red Hat)
support Secure Boot to ensure that programs loaded by firmware during the boot are trustworthy.
Secure Boot holds digital signatures, encryption keys, and drivers in databases stored in flash memory on the
motherboard and/or on the hard drive. Initially, the motherboard manufacturer stores the data on the motherboard
before it is shipped. This data is provided by OS and hardware manufacturers.
After the OS is installed, UEFI databases are stored in a system partition named efi on the hard drive. Database
names are db (approved digital signatures), dbx (blacklist of signatures), and KEK (signatures maintained by the OS
manufacturer). After an OS is installed on the hard drive, updates to the OS include updates to the KEK. The Platform
Key (PK) is a digital signature that belongs to the motherboard or computer manufacturer. The PK authorizes turning
Secure Boot on or off and updating the KEK database.
When Secure Boot is enabled, it checks each driver, the OS, and applications before UEFI launches these programs during the early stages of the boot to verify it is signed and identified in the Secure Boot databases. After the
OS is launched, it can load additional drivers and applications that UEFI Secure Boot does not verify.
For normal operation, you would not be required to change Secure Boot settings unless you want to install
hardware or an OS (for example, Kali Linux) that is not certified by the computer manufacturer. In this situation,
you could disable Secure Boot. Before you make any changes to the Secure Boot screen, be sure to use the option
to save Secure Boot keys if that option is available. Doing so saves all the databases to a USB flash drive so you can
backtrack your changes later if needed.
Take a look at Figure 2-29, which shows the Security screen for one laptop where Secure Boot can be enabled or
disabled. Also notice the option highlighted to Restore Factory Keys. This option may be helpful if BIOS/UEFI refuses
to allow a fresh installation of an OS or hardware device. On this system, before you can enable Secure Boot, you
must go to the Boot screen and select UEFI as the Boot Mode.

Manage CSM and UEFI Boot
The Boot screen allows you to select UEFI mode or CSM (also called Legacy Support) mode. UEFI mode is required
for Secure Boot to be enabled. For example, in Figure 2-30, you first must disable Fast Boot, and then you can select
either CSM (Compatibility Support Module) or Secure Boot. When you select Secure Boot, UEFI mode is enabled.
Use CSM for backward compatibility with older BIOS devices and drivers and MBR hard drives.

Configuring Onboard Devices
Core 1 Objective 3.4
You can enable or disable some onboard devices (for example, a wireless LAN, a network port, USB ports, or video
ports) using BIOS/UEFI setup. For one system, the Configuration screen shown in Figure 2-31 does the job. On this
screen, you can enable or disable a port or group of ports; you can configure the Front Panel Audio ports for Auto,
High Definition audio, and Legacy audio; or you can disable these audio ports. What you can configure on your
system depends on the onboard devices the motherboard offers.
In BIOS/UEFI you might encounter a couple of options for the USB ports. One possible setting you can change is
USB power share, which enables you to charge a USB device even when the computer is turned off. Another setting
is USB wake support, which allows a USB device to wake a computer on action.

Processor and Clock Speeds
Overclocking is running a processor, memory, motherboard, or video card at a higher speed than the manufacturer
recommends. Some motherboards and processors allow overclocking, but it is not a recommended best practice. If
you decide to overclock a system, pay careful attention to the temperature of the processor so it does not overheat;
overheating can damage the processor.
Configuring Security Features
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Other security features besides Secure Boot are power-on passwords, drive password protection, the TPM chip,
HSMs, and drive encryption. All are discussed next.
Power-On Passwords
Power-on passwords are assigned in BIOS/UEFI setup to prevent unauthorized access to the computer and/or the
BIOS/UEFI setup utility. For one motherboard, this security screen looks like the one shown in Figure 2-32, where

You don’t have to replace an entire motherboard if one port fails. For example, if the network port fails, use BIOS/UEFI
setup to disable the port. Then use an expansion card for the port instead.

Caution
In the event that passwords are forgotten, supervisor and user passwords to the computer can be reset by setting a
jumper (group of pins) on the motherboard to clear all BIOS/UEFI customized settings and return BIOS/UEFI setup to
its default settings. To keep someone from using this technique to access the computer, you can use a computer case
with a lockable side panel and install a lock on the case. Using jumpers is covered later in this module.
Also, the BIOS/UEFI utility might have an intrusion detection alert feature that requires a cable to be connected to a
switch on the case. When the case is opened, the action is logged in BIOS/UEFI and a message appears at the beginning
of the boot that an intrusion has been detected. This security feature is easily bypassed by hackers and is therefore
not considered a best practice.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to use BIOS/UEFI setup to secure a workstation from unauthorized use.
you can set a supervisor password and a user password. In addition, you can configure how the user password
works.
The choices under User Access Level are No Access (the user cannot access the BIOS/UEFI setup utility), View
Only (the user can access BIOS/UEFI setup but cannot make changes), Limited (the user can access BIOS/UEFI setup
and make a few changes, such as date and time), and Full Access (the user can access the BIOS/UEFI setup utility
and make any changes). When supervisor and user passwords are both set and you boot the system, a box to enter
a password is displayed. The access you have depends on which password you enter. Also, if both passwords are
set, you must enter a valid password to boot the system. By setting both passwords, you can totally lock down the
computer from unauthorized access.
Drive Password Protection
Some laptop BIOS/UEFI utilities offer the option to set a hard drive password. For example, look back at Figure 2-29
and the option Set Hard Disk Password. Using this option, you can set Master and User passwords for all hard drives
installed in the system. When you first turn on the computer, you must enter a power-on password to boot the computer and a hard drive password to access the hard drive.
Using a hard drive password encrypts only a few organizational sectors—not all the data on the drive. Therefore, a hacker can move the drive to another computer and use software that can read sectors where data is kept
without having to read the organizational sectors. Password-protected drives are therefore not as secure as drive
encryption, which is discussed next.
The TPM Chip, HSMs, and Hard Drive Encryption
Many motherboards contain a chip called the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip. The BitLocker Encryption tool
in Windows is designed to work with this chip, which holds the BitLocker encryption key (also called the startup
key). The TPM chip can also be used with encryption software other than BitLocker that may be installed on the
hard drive. If the hard drive is stolen from the computer and installed in another computer, the data will be safe
because BitLocker has encrypted all contents on the drive and will not allow access without the startup key stored
on the TPM chip. Therefore, this method assures that the drive cannot be used in another computer. However, if
the motherboard fails and is replaced, you’ll need a backup copy of the startup key to access data on the hard drive.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about drive encryption, the TPM chip, and how to use both to secure a
workstation or laptop.

When you use Windows to install BitLocker Encryption, the initialization process also initializes the TPM chip.
Initializing the TPM chip configures it and turns it on. After BitLocker is installed, you can temporarily turn it off,
which also turns off the TPM chip. For example, you might want to turn off BitLocker to test the BitLocker recovery
process. Normally, BitLocker will manage the TPM chip for
you, and there is no need for you to manually change TPM
chip settings. However, if you are having problems installing
BitLocker, one thing you can do is clear the TPM chip. Be
careful! If the TPM chip is being used to hold an encryption
key to protect data on the hard drive and you clear the chip,
the encryption key will be lost. That means all the data will
be lost, too. Therefore, don’t clear the TPM chip unless you
are certain it is not being used to encrypt data.
Drive encryption might still be needed when the system
does not have a TPM chip or the chip is not working. In
this situation, you can install in the system an encryption
device called a hardware security module (HSM). An HSM
can be installed on a workstation or server computer using
an expansion card, as in Figure 2-33, as a small external USB
device connected to a single computer, or as a larger appliance that connects to the network to service applications
and devices on the network.
Figure 2-33 An HSM expansion card offers
drive encryption when the TPM
chip isn’t available

Drive encryption might be too secure at times. I know of a situation where an encrypted hard drive became corrupted.
Normally, you might be able to move the drive to another computer and recover some data. However, this drive asked
for the encryption password but then could not confirm it. Therefore, the entire drive, including all the data, was
inaccessible.
Note 4
BIOS Support for Virtualization
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Virtualization in computing is when one physical computer uses software to create multiple virtual computers, and
each virtual computer or virtual machine (VM) simulates the hardware of a physical computer. Each VM running
on a computer works like a physical computer and is assigned virtual devices such as a virtual motherboard and
virtual hard drive. Examples of VM software are Microsoft Hyper-V and Oracle VirtualBox. For most VM software
to work, virtualization must be enabled in BIOS/UEFI setup. Looking back at Figure 2-32, you can see the option to
enable Intel VT, the name Intel gives to its virtualization technology.
Exiting the BIOS/UEFI Setup Menus
Core 1 Objective 3.4
When you finish with BIOS/UEFI setup, an Exit screen such as the one shown in Figure 2-34 gives you various options,
such as saving your changes and exiting or discarding your changes and exiting. Notice in the figure that you also
have the option to Load Optimized Defaults. This option can sometimes solve a problem if a user has made several
inappropriate changes to the BIOS/UEFI settings or if you are attempting to recover from an error created while
updating the firmware.

Managing the TPM Chip
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.4
To manage the TPM chip, follow these steps:
1. In BIOS/UEFI, verify that the TPM chip is enabled.
2. Sign in to Windows using an administrator account.
3. In the Windows search box, enter the tpm.msc command. If necessary, respond to the UAC box. The
TPM Management console opens.
4. If no TPM chip is present or it’s not enabled in BIOS/UEFI setup, the console reports that. If your system
has a TPM chip that is not yet initialized, the Status pane in the console reports TPM is not ready for
use (see Figure 2-35). To initialize the TPM, click Prepare the TPM in the Actions pane. After Windows
initializes the TPM and you close the dialog box, the console will report that the TPM is ready for use
(also shown in Figure 2-35).

5. Using the console, you can change the TPM owner password, turn TPM on or off in Windows, reset the
TPM when it has locked access to the hard drive, and clear the TPM, which resets it to factory defaults.
After you have made changes to the TPM chip, you will most likely be asked to restart the computer for
the changes to take effect.
Updating Motherboard Drivers
and BIOS/UEFI
Core 1 Objective 3.4
When a motherboard is first installed or causing problems or you want to use a new OS or hardware device, you
might need to install or update the motherboard drivers or update the BIOS/UEFI firmware. Both skills are covered
in this section of the module.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to update drivers and firmware and replace the CMOS battery. Given
the symptom of a problem, you must first determine if the source of the problem is a device, motherboard firmware,
or the CMOS battery, and then decide what to do to resolve the problem.

The motherboard CD or DVD or the manufacturer’s website might contain useful utilities—for example, a utility to
monitor the CPU temperature and alert you if overheating occurs or a diagnostics utility for troubleshooting. You might
also find a utility that works in Windows or Linux to update the BIOS/UEFI firmware.
Note 5
Installing or Updating Motherboard Drivers
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Device drivers are small programs stored on the hard drive that an operating system such as Windows or Linux
uses to communicate with a specific hardware device—for example, a printer, network port on the motherboard,
or video card. The CD or DVD that comes bundled with the motherboard contains a user guide and drivers for its
onboard components (for example, chipset, graphics, audio, network, and USB drivers), and these drivers need to
be installed in the OS. After installing a motherboard, you can install the drivers from CD or DVD and later update
them by downloading updates from the motherboard manufacturer’s website. Updates to motherboard drivers are
sometimes included in updates to Windows.
If you don’t have the CD or DVD that came with the motherboard or you want to update the drivers already
installed on the system, go to the motherboard manufacturer website to find the downloads you need. Figure 2-36
shows the download page for the ASUS Prime B460M-A motherboard. On this page, you can download manuals,
drivers, utility tools, and BIOS/UEFI updates for the board. You can also access a list of CPUs and memory modules
the board can use. Be sure to get the correct drivers for the OS edition and type (for example, Windows 10 64-bit)
you are using with the board.

Caution
It’s extremely important that you use the correct motherboard brand and model when selecting the BIOS/UEFI update
on the manufacturer’s website. Trying to use the wrong update can cause problems. Also, get your updates directly
from the manufacturer website rather than third-party sites.
To flash BIOS/UEFI, always follow the directions that you can find in the user guide for your motherboard.
Motherboards can use one or more of these methods:
●● Download and update from within BIOS/UEFI setup. Some motherboards allow you to enter BIOS/UEFI
setup and select the option for BIOS/UEFI to connect to the Internet, check for updates, download the
update, and apply it.
●● Update from a USB flash drive using BIOS/UEFI setup. Download the latest firmware update file for your
BIOS/UEFI version from the manufacturer website and store it on a USB flash drive that is formatted using
the FAT32 file system (not the NTFS file system). Then restart the system and launch BIOS/UEFI setup. Select
the option to flash BIOS/UEFI and point to the USB drive for the update. Alternately, you might press a key
at startup to launch the update rather than launch BIOS/UEFI setup. (For some motherboard brands, you
press F7.) The update is applied and the system restarts.
●● Run an express BIOS/UEFI update. An express BIOS/UEFI update is done from within Windows. You use
Windows application software available on the motherboard manufacturer website to check for, download,
and install firmware updates. Alternately, you might be instructed to download the firmware update and
double-click it to start the update. Because too many things can go wrong using Windows to update BIOS/
UEFI, it is not a recommended best practice.
Be aware of these cautions when updating BIOS/UEFI firmware:
●● Don’t update firmware without a good reason. Makers of BIOS/UEFI typically provide updates frequently
because putting the upgrade on the Internet is so easy for them. Generally, however, follow the principle that
“if it’s not broken, don’t fix it.” Update your firmware only if you’re having a problem with your motherboard
or there’s a new BIOS/UEFI feature you want to use.
●● Back up first. Before attempting to update the firmware, back up the firmware to a USB flash drive, if possible. See the motherboard user manual to find out how.
●● Select the correct update file. Always use an update version that is more recent than the BIOS/UEFI version
already installed, and carefully follow manufacturer directions. Upgrading with the wrong file could make
your BIOS/UEFI useless. If you’re not sure that you’re using the correct upgrade, don’t guess. Check with
the technical support for your BIOS/UEFI before moving forward. Before you call technical support, have
the information available that identifies your BIOS/UEFI and motherboard.
Updating Firmware
Core 1 Objective 3.4
The process of upgrading or refreshing the programming and data stored on the firmware chip is called updating
firmware, flashing BIOS/UEFI, or flashing BIOS. Here are some good reasons to flash the BIOS/UEFI:
●● The system hangs at odd times or during the boot.
●● Some motherboard functions have stopped working or are causing problems. For example, the onboard
video port is not working.
●● You get errors when trying to install a new OS or hardware device.
●● You want to incorporate some new features or a new component on the board. For example, a BIOS upgrade
might be required before you upgrade the processor.

To identify the BIOS/UEFI version installed, look for the BIOS version number displayed on the main menu of BIOS/UEFI
setup. Alternately, you can use the System Information utility (msinfo32.exe) in Windows to display the BIOS version.
Note 7
●● Don’t interrupt the update. Be sure not to turn off your computer while the update is in progress. For
laptops, make sure the AC adapter is plugged in and powering the system.
If the BIOS update is interrupted or the update creates errors, you are in an unfortunate situation. Search the
motherboard manufacturer website for help. Here are some options:
●● Back flash. You might be able to revert to the earlier version, which is called a back flash. To do this, generally you download the recovery file from the website and copy the file to a USB flash drive. Then set the
jumper on the motherboard to recover from a failed BIOS update. When you reboot the system, the BIOS
automatically reads from the device and performs the recovery. Then reset the jumper to the normal setting and boot the system.
●● Bootable media and restore defaults. You might be instructed to make a bootable CD or DVD using support tools from the motherboard manufacturer. Boot the system from the CD or DVD and enter commands
to attempt the update again from the file stored on the USB flash drive. Then enter BIOS/UEFI setup and
restore defaults.
If a BIOS/UEFI update fails to complete, BIOS/UEFI may reboot and try again up to three times. After the third attempt,
the update will be discarded, and the firmware will roll back a partial update.
Note 8
Using Jumpers to Clear BIOS/UEFI Settings
Core 1 Objective 3.4
A motherboard may have jumpers that you can use to clear BIOS/UEFI settings, which returns the BIOS/UEFI setup
to factory default settings. You might want to clear settings if flashing BIOS/UEFI didn’t work or failed to complete
correctly, or if a power-on password is forgotten and you cannot boot the system.
A laptop or other mobile device likely won’t have this option available for better security of the device.
Note 9
A jumper is two small posts or metal pins that stick up on the motherboard; it’s used to hold configuration
information. An open jumper has no cover, and a closed jumper has a cover on the two pins (see Figure 2-37). Look
at the jumper cover in Figure 2-37(B) that is “parked,” meaning it is hanging on a single pin for safekeeping but is
not being used to turn on a jumper setting.

BIOS/UEFI will recover itself on the next boot from a failed update. Once set for normal booting, the jumpers should
be changed only if you are trying to recover when a power-up password is lost or flashing BIOS/UEFI has failed. To
learn how to set jumpers, see the motherboard documentation.
Now let’s see what other tasks you might need to do when you are installing or replacing a motherboard.
Installing or Replacing a Motherboard
Core 1 Objective 3.4
A motherboard is considered a field replaceable unit, so you need to know how to replace one when it goes bad. In
this part of the module, you learn how to select a motherboard and then how to install or replace one in a desktop
or laptop computer.
How to Select a Desktop Motherboard
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Because the motherboard determines so many of your computer’s features, selecting the motherboard is often your
most important decision when you purchase a desktop computer or assemble one from parts. Depending on which
applications and peripheral devices you plan to use with the computer, you can take one of three approaches to
selecting a motherboard. The first approach is to select the board that provides the most room for expansion, so
you can upgrade and exchange components and add devices easily. A second approach is to select the board that
best suits the needs of the computer’s current configuration, knowing that when you need to upgrade, you will likely
switch to new technology and a new motherboard. The third approach is to select a motherboard that meets your
present needs with moderate room for expansion.
Ask the following questions when selecting a motherboard:
1. How is the motherboard going to be used? (For example, it might be used for light business and personal
use, as a gaming system, for a server, or for a high-powered workstation.) Knowing how the board will be
used helps you decide about the most important features and overall power of the board. For example,
a motherboard to be used in a server might need support for RAID (an array of multiple hard drives to
improve performance and fault tolerance). In another example, a motherboard used in a gaming system
will not need RAID support but might need a chipset that supports two high-end graphics adapters.
2. What form factor does the motherboard use?
3. Which brand (Intel or AMD) and model processors does the board support? Which chipset does it use?
Which processors does it support?
Most motherboard manufacturers offer a motherboard model in two versions: one version with an
Intel chipset and a second version with an AMD chipset. Here are the criteria to decide which brand of
chipset to use:
●● If price is a concern, consider a board with an AMD chipset, which generally costs less than
comparable boards with Intel chipsets.
●● AMD is popular in the hobbyist and gaming market, and many of its chipsets and processors are
designed with high-end graphics in mind. AMD puts graphics first and processing power second.
For the hobbyist, many AMD processors can be overclocked.
●● Intel offers the most options in processor models and chipset and processor features. Intel typically
targets the consumer, business, and server markets, and generally is strong in power conservation,
processing power, and graphics.
●● Intel dominates the laptop, pre-built desktop, consumer, and server markets.
4. Which type and speed of memory does the board support?
5. What are the embedded expansion slots, internal and external connectors, and devices on the board?
(For example, the board might provide multiple PCIe 316 v4 slots, SATA3 connectors, a network
port, a wireless component, multiple USB ports, an M.2 slot, HDMI port, DVI-D port, and so forth.)

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
6. Does the board fit the case you plan to use?
7. What is the price of the board? Does the board get good reviews?
8. How extensive and user-friendly is the documentation, and how helpful is the manufacturer website?
9. What warranty and how much support does the manufacturer supply for the board?
Sometimes a motherboard contains an onboard component more commonly offered as a separate device. One
example is support for video. The video port might be on the motherboard, or it might require a video card. A
motherboard with embedded video is less expensive than a motherboard and a graphics card you plan to install in
a PCIe 316 slot, but the latter plan gives higher-quality video.
If you have an embedded component, make sure you can disable it so you can use another external component if
needed. Components are disabled in BIOS/UEFI setup.
Note 10
Get very familiar with the manufacturer’s website of the motherboard you plan to purchase. It tells you which processors and memory modules the board can support. Make sure the processor and memory you plan to use with the
board are on these lists.
Note 11
Table 2-3, shown earlier in the module, lists some manufacturers of motherboards and their web addresses. For
motherboard reviews, do a general search of the web.
How to Install or Replace a Motherboard
Core 1 Objective 3.4
When you purchase a motherboard, the package comes with the board, I/O shield, documentation, drivers, and various screws, cables, and connectors. When you replace a motherboard, you pretty much have to disassemble an entire
computer, install the new motherboard, and reassemble the system, which you learned to do in the module “Taking a
Computer Apart and Putting It Back Together.” The following steps are meant to be a general overview of the process
and are not meant to include the details of all possible installation scenarios, which can vary according to the components and case you are using. The best place to go for detailed installation instructions is the motherboard user guide.
Caution
As with any installation, remember the importance of using an ESD strap to ground yourself when working inside a
computer case to protect components against ESD. Other precautions to protect the hardware and you are covered in
the appendix “Safety Procedures and Environmental Concerns.”
The general process for replacing a motherboard is as follows:
1. Verify that you have selected the right motherboard to install in the system. The new motherboard
should have the same form factor as the case, support the RAM modules and processor you want to
install on it, and have other internal and external connectors you need for your system.
2. Get familiar with the motherboard documentation, features, and settings. Especially important are any
connectors and jumpers on the motherboard. It’s a great idea to read the motherboard user guide from
cover to cover. At the least, get familiar with what it has to offer, and study the diagrams in it that label
all the components on the board. Learn how each connector and jumper is used. You can also check the
manufacturer’s website for answers to any questions you might have.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
3. Remove components so you can reach the old motherboard. Use an ESD strap. Turn off the system,
and disconnect all cables and cords. Press the power button to dissipate the power. Open the case
cover, and remove all expansion cards. Disconnect all internal cables and cords connected to the old
motherboard. To safely remove the old motherboard, you might have to remove drives. If the processor
cooler is heavy and bulky, you might remove it from the old motherboard before you remove the
motherboard from the case.
4. Install the I/O shield. The I/O shield is a metal plate that comes with the motherboard and fits over the
ports to create a well-fitting enclosure for them. A case might come with a standard I/O shield already in
place. Hold the motherboard up to the shield, and make sure the ports on the board will fit the holes in
the shield (see Figure 2-40). If the holes in the shield don’t match up with the ports on the board, punch
out the shield, and replace it with the one that came bundled with the motherboard.
Figure 2-40 Make sure the holes in the I/O shield match up with the ports on the
motherboard

5. Install the motherboard. Place
the motherboard into the case
and, using spacers or screws,
securely fasten the board to the
case. Because coolers are heavy,
most processor instructions say
to install the motherboard before
installing the processor and cooler
to better protect the board or
processor from being damaged. On
the other hand, some motherboard
manufacturers say to install the
processor and cooler and then
install the motherboard. Follow the
order given in the motherboard
user guide. The easiest approach is
to install the processor, cooler, and
memory modules on the board and
then place the board in the case
(see Figure 2-41).

6. Install the processor and processor cooler. The processor comes already installed on some
motherboards, in which case you just need to install the cooler. The steps for installing a processor and
cooler are covered in the module “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory.”
7. Install RAM into the appropriate slots on the motherboard. You learn how to install RAM in the module
“Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory.”
8. Attach the wires and cables. Attach the wire leads from the front panel of the case to the front panel
connector or header on the motherboard, as you learned to do in the module “Taking a Computer Apart
and Putting It Back Together.” You’ll also need to attach the P1 power connector, fan connectors, processor
auxiliary power connector, and SATA cables to the internal drives. If the case has ports on the front, such
as USB or sound ports, connect cables from the ports to the appropriate headers on the motherboard.
Position and tie cables neatly together to make sure they don’t obstruct the fans and the airflow.
9. Install the video card on the motherboard. If the motherboard does not have onboard video, install
the video card now. It should go into the primary PCI Express 316 slot. If the motherboard has onboard
video, use the video port, and check out how the system functions until you know everything else is
working. Then go back and install an optional video card. If you plan to install two video cards, verify
that one is working before installing the second one.
10. Plug the computer into a power source, and attach the monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Initially install
only the devices you absolutely need.
11. Boot the system and enter BIOS/UEFI setup. Make sure the settings are set to the defaults. If the
motherboard comes new from the manufacturer, it will already be at default settings. If you are salvaging
a motherboard from another system, you might need to reset settings to the defaults. You will need to
do the following while you are in BIOS/UEFI setup:
●● Check the time and date.
●● Make sure Fast Boot (also called abbreviated POST) is disabled. While you’re installing a
motherboard, you generally want it to do as many diagnostic tests as possible. After you know the
system is working, you can choose Fast Boot.
●● Set the boot order to the hard drive, and then the USB drive, if you will be booting the OS from the
hard drive.
●● Leave everything else at their defaults unless you know that particular settings should be otherwise.
●● Save and exit.
12. Observe POST and verify that no errors occur.
13. Verify that Windows starts with no errors. If Windows is already installed on the hard drive, boot to the
Windows desktop. Use Device Manager to verify that the OS recognizes all devices and that no conflicts
are reported.
14. Install the motherboard drivers. If your motherboard comes with a CD or DVD that contains some
motherboard drivers, install them now. You will probably need Internet access so the setup process can
download the latest drivers from the motherboard manufacturer’s website. Reboot the system one more
time, checking for errors.
15. Install any other expansion cards and drivers. Install each device and its drivers, one device at a time,
rebooting and checking for conflicts after each installation.
16. Verify that everything is operating properly, and make any final OS and BIOS/UEFI adjustments, such
as setting power-on passwords.
Whenever you install or uninstall software or hardware, keep a notebook with details about the components you are
working on, configuration settings, manufacturer specifications, and other relevant information. This helps if you need
to backtrack later and can also help you document and troubleshoot your computer system. Keep all hardware documentation for this system together with the notebook in an envelope in a safe place.

Module Summary
Motherboard Types and Features
●● The motherboard is the most complicated of all components inside the computer. It contains the processor
socket and accompanying chipset, firmware holding the BIOS/UEFI, memory slots, expansion slots, jumpers,
ports, and power supply connections. Sometimes, the processor is embedded on the board. The motherboard you select determines both the capabilities and limitations of your system.
●● The most popular motherboard form factors are ATX, microATX, Extended ATX, and ITX. The form factor
determines the size of the board and the case and power supply the board can use.
●● The chipset embedded on the motherboard determines what kind of processor and memory the board can
support.
●● Typically, a motherboard will have one or more Intel sockets for an Intel processor or one or more AMD
sockets for an AMD processor.
●● Major advancements in past Intel chipsets and processors are labeled as generations and include 12th
generation (Alder Lake), 11th generation (Rocket Lake), 10th generation (Comet Lake), 9th generation (Coffee
Lake Refresh), 8th generation (Coffee Lake), 7th generation (Kaby Lake), and 6th generation (Skylake).
●● Current Intel desktop processors use the LGA1700, LGA1200 or LGA1151 socket. Server processors use the
LGA2066 or LGA2011 socket.
●● Current AMD processors use the sTRX4, TR4, AM4, AM31, AM3, or FM21 socket. These sockets are used
to identify the current AMD generations of chipsets and processors.
●● When matching a motherboard to a processor, use only processors the motherboard manufacturer recommends for the board. Even though a processor might fit the processor socket on a board, using a match not
recommended by the manufacturer can damage both the board and the processor.
●● For laptops, it’s usually more cost effective to replace the laptop than to replace a failed system board.
●● Current buses and expansion slots used on motherboards include PCI Express 31, 34, 38, and 316, Versions
3, 4, 5, and 6; conventional PCI; SATAe; SATA Revision 3.x; SATA Revision 2.x; SAS; M.2; and USB.
●● Components that are built into the motherboard are called onboard components. Other components can be
attached to the system in some other way, such as on an expansion card, internal connector, or external port.
Using BIOS/UEFI Setup to Configure a Motherboard
●● The firmware that controls current motherboards is a combination of the older BIOS and the newer UEFI.
Microsoft requires UEFI firmware in order for a system to be certified for Windows 10.
●● UEFI supports the GPT partitioning system for hard drives, which supports hard drives larger than 2 TB.
The older MBR partitioning system is limited to drives smaller than 2 TB.
●● Booting using UEFI mode is required to use Windows Secure Boot, which protects a system against malware
launching before Windows or anti-malware software is started. For legacy hardware and operating systems,
a UEFI system can be booted in CSM or legacy mode, which is a BIOS boot.
●● Motherboard settings that can be configured using BIOS/UEFI setup include changing the boot priority order,
managing Secure Boot options, selecting UEFI mode or CSM mode, enabling or disabling onboard devices,
overclocking the CPU, and managing power-on passwords, the TPM chip, and support for virtualization.
You can also view information about the installed processor, memory, storage devices, CPU and chassis
temperatures, fan speeds, and voltages.
●● Secure Boot uses databases to verify that hardware drivers are digitally signed by their manufacturers.
These databases are stored in firmware on the motherboard before the board ships and later on the Windows hard drive. Updating firmware can update databases in firmware, and you can restore these databases
to their factory state. In addition, Microsoft may include updates to its Secure Boot databases kept on the
hard drive in normal Windows updates. Secure Boot must be enabled before Windows 11 will install.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Updating Motherboard Drivers and BIOS/UEFI
●● Device drivers for motherboard components are installed in the operating system when you first install a
motherboard. These drivers might need updating to fix a problem with a board component or to use a new
feature provided by the motherboard manufacturer. Drivers come bundled on CD or DVD with the motherboard and can be downloaded from the motherboard manufacturer website.
●● Update motherboard firmware when a component on the board is causing problems or you want to incorporate a new feature or component on the board.
●● To update BIOS/UEFI, you can use BIOS/UEFI setup to check online for updates and apply them, or you
can apply updates previously downloaded to a USB flash drive. Alternately, you might be able to install
an app in Windows that can check for BIOS/UEFI updates and apply them; however, this option is not
recommended.
●● When flashing BIOS/UEFI, don’t update firmware without a good reason, back up the firmware before you
update it, be certain to select the correct update file, and make sure the update process is not interrupted.
●● Jumpers on the motherboard may be used to clear BIOS/UEFI settings, restoring them to factory defaults.
Installing or Replacing a Motherboard
●● When selecting a motherboard, pay attention to the form factor, chipset, expansion slots and memory slots
used, and the processors supported in reference to the purpose of the computer. Also notice the internal
and external connectors and ports the board provides.
●● When installing a motherboard, first study the motherboard and its manual, and set jumpers on the board.
Sometimes it is best to install the processor and cooler before installing the motherboard in the case. When
the cooling assembly is heavy and bulky, you should install it after the motherboard is securely seated in
the case. Finally, install the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website.

Introduction
Previously, you learned about motherboards. In this module, you learn about the two most important components
on the motherboard: the processor and memory. You learn how a processor works, about different types and brands
of processors, and how to match a processor to the motherboard.
Memory technologies have evolved over the years. When you support an assortment of desktop and laptop
computers, you’ll be amazed at all the variations of memory modules used not only in newer computers, but also in
older computers still in use. A simple problem of replacing a bad memory module can become a complex research
project if you don’t have a good grasp of current and legacy memory technologies.
The processor and memory modules are considered field replaceable units (FRUs), so you’ll learn how to install
and upgrade a processor and memory modules. Upgrading the processor or adding more memory to a system can
sometimes greatly improve performance. You will learn how to troubleshoot problems with the processor or memory
in the module “Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer Problems.”

The processor installed on a motherboard is the primary component that determines the computing power of
the system (see Figure 3-1). Recall that the two major manufacturers of processors are Intel (intel.com) and AMD
(amd.com).

Here are the features of a processor that affect performance and compatibility with motherboards:
●● Feature 1: Processor speed. The processor frequency is the speed at which the processor operates
internally and is measured in gigahertz, such as 3.3 GHz. Current Intel and AMD processors run from about
2.0 GHz up to more than 5.3 GHz.
●● Feature 2: Lithography. The lithography is the average space between transistors printed on the surface of
the silicon chip. The measurement is in nanometers (nm); 1 nm is 1 billionth of a meter. Current processor
lithography ranges from 7 nm to 14 nm. The lower the measurement, the better and faster the processor
performs.
●● Feature 3: Socket and chipset the processor can use. Recall that current Intel sockets for desktop and
server systems are LGA1700, LGA1200, LGA1151, LGA2066, and LGA2011. AMD’s current desktop sockets
are sTRX4, TR4, AM4, AM31, AM3, and FM21.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Feature 4: Multiprocessing abilities. The ability of a system to do more than one task at a time is accomplished by several means:
■ Multiprocessing. Using two processing units (called arithmetic logic units or ALUs) installed within a
single processor is called multiprocessing. With multiprocessing, the processor, also called the core,
can execute two instructions at the same time.
■ Multithreading. Each processor or core processes two threads at the same time. When Windows
hands off a task to the CPU, it is called a thread and might involve several instructions. To handle two
threads, the processor requires extra registers, or holding areas, within the processor housing that it
uses to switch between threads. In effect, you have two logical processors for each physical processor
or core. Intel calls this technology Hyper-Threading and AMD calls it HyperTransport. The feature
must be enabled in BIOS/UEFI setup, and the operating system (OS) must support the technology.
■ Multicore processing. A single processor in the processor package is called single-core processing,
and using multiple processors installed in the same processor housing is called multicore processing.
Multicore processing might contain up to 32 cores (dual-core, triple-core, quad-core, and so forth).
In Figure 3-2, the quad-core processor contains four cores or CPUs. Using multithreading, each core can

and each core can handle two threads

Figure 3-3 This Intel Server Board S2600ST has two Xeon processor
sockets and 16 slots for DDR4 memory
handle two threads. Therefore, the processor
appears to have up to eight logical processors,
as it can handle eight threads from the
operating system.
■ Dual processors. A server motherboard
might have two processor sockets, called
multisocket, dual processors, or a
multiprocessor platform (see Figure 3-3).
A processor (for example, the Xeon processor
for servers) must support this feature.
●● Feature 5: Memory cache, which is the amount
of memory included within the processor package. Today’s processors all have some memory on
the processor chip (called a die). Memory on the
processor die is called Level 1 cache (L1 cache).
Today’s processors might have 8 MB to 64 MB of
L1 cache. In addition to L1 cache, a processor may Source: intel.

have some Level 2 cache (L2 cache), which is memory in the processor package but not on the processor
die. Some processors use a third cache farther from the processor’s core, but still in the processor package,
which is called Level 3 cache (L3 cache).
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to select a processor for a given motherboard, considering these processor
features: Hyper-Threading, number of cores, virtualization, overclocking, and the motherboard CPU socket.
To know which type of operating system is installed (32-bit or 64-bit) and other information about the Windows installation, open the About window. Open the Settings app and click System. Click About in the left panel of the System
page to view system information. Figure 3-4 shows the About page.
Note 2
Memory used in a memory cache is static RAM (SRAM; pronounced “S-Ram”). Memory used on the motherboard loses
data rapidly and must be refreshed often. It is therefore called dynamic RAM (DRAM; pronounced “D-Ram”). SRAM is
faster than DRAM because it doesn’t need refreshing. Both SRAM and DRAM are called volatile memory because they
can only hold data as long as power is available.
Note 1
●● Feature 6: The memory features on the motherboard that the processor can support. DRAM memory
modules used on a motherboard that a processor might support include DDR3, DDR4, or DDR5. Besides the
type of memory, a processor can support certain amounts of memory, memory speeds, and a number of
memory channels (single, dual, triple, or quad channels). All these characteristics of memory are discussed
later in the module.
●● Feature 7: Support for virtualization. A computer can use software to create and manage multiple virtual
machines and their virtual devices. Most processors sold today support virtualization. The feature must
be enabled in BIOS/UEFI setup.
●● Feature 8: Overclocking. Some processors are designed to allow for overclocking, which is to run
the processor at a higher frequency than recommended by the processor manufacturer. As you learned
in the module “All About Motherboards,” if a CPU and motherboard support overclocking, it is managed in
BIOS/UEFI.
Older processors could process 32 bits at a time and were known as x86 processors because Intel used the
number 86 in their model number. Today’s processor architectures fall into two categories:
●● Hybrid processors can process 32 bits or 64 bits. All of today’s processors for desktop systems can process either 32 bits or 64 bits. These hybrid processors are known as x86-64 bit processors. An operating
system, such as Windows or Linux, is installed as a 32-bit OS or a 64-bit OS. For most situations, when the OS
installation gives you the option, you should choose to install it as a 64-bit OS to get the best performance.
Applications are created as 32-bit apps or 64-bit apps, and both can be installed in a 64-bit OS. However, you
cannot install a 64-bit app in a 32-bit installation of an OS.
●● 64-bit processors. Intel makes several 64-bit processors for workstations or servers that use fully implemented 64-bit processing, including the Itanium and Xeon processors. Intel calls the technology IA64, but
they are also called x64 processors. They require a 64-bit operating system and can handle 32-bit applications only by simulating 32-bit processing.

Intel Processors
Core 1 Objective 3.4
As you learned in the module “All About Motherboards,” Intel groups its processors in generations. (Recall that
the 12th generation, also called Alder Lake, and the 11th generation, Rocket Lake, were released in 2021.) Intel also
groups its processors in families that can span several generations. To find details about any Intel processor, search
the Intel ARK database at ark.intel.com. Current families of processors for desktops and laptops include the following:
●● The Intel Core processors, first introduced in the 2nd generation, target the mid- to high-end consumer
market and are currently Intel’s most popular processor family:
■ Core X-series are made for the most powerful high-end desktops with graphics-heavy usage in mind.
These processors are ideal for gaming, animation, photo and video editing, creation, and development.
■ Core i9 and Core i7 are made for high-end desktops and laptops. The latest Core i9 processor has up to
16 cores, 5.3 GHz, and a 16 MB cache.
■ Core i5 is well suited for mainstream desktops and laptops (see Figure 3-5).
■ Core i3 is an entry-level processor for desktops and laptops.
●● Pentium processors are designed for entry-level desktops and laptops.
●● Atom is made for low-end desktops, netbooks, and laptops, and the Celeron is made for low-end netbooks
and laptops.
Intel dominates the processor and chipset market for servers with highly stable and powerful processors. Some
models of the Core i9, Core i7, Core i5, and Core i3 processors are designed for server use, and some of the Atom
processors target energy-efficient servers. For highend servers, Intel offers the Xeon and Xeon Scalable
processors. Processors designed for servers are more
expensive because they are more stable and error-free
than comparable desktop processors.

system installed
Notice the processor in Figure 3-5 is advertised as
unlocked, which means it can be overclocked.

AMD Processors
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Processors by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD (amd.com), are popular in the game and hobbyist markets and
are generally less expensive than comparable Intel processors. Recall that AMD processors use different sockets
than Intel processors, so the motherboard must be designed for one manufacturer’s processor or the other, but not
both. Many motherboard manufacturers offer two comparable motherboards—one for an Intel processor and one
for an AMD processor.
The current AMD processor families include the following:
●● For desktops, the Ryzen, Ryzen Threadripper, Ryzen with Graphics, Athlon with Graphics, Ryzen Pro,
and Athlon Pro. The Threadripper can have up to 64 cores. A Threadripper processor by AMD was shown
earlier in Figure 3-1.
●● For laptops, the Ryzen, Athlon, and Chromebook.
●● For servers, the EPYC can have up to 64 cores.
ARM Processors
Core 1 Objective 3.4
ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is a processor architecture designed to simplify the instruction set used for computing. Arm Limited, the company behind the ARM technology, is not a manufacturer; rather, the company licenses

In the next section of the module, you learn the detailed steps to select and install a processor in several of the
popular Intel and AMD sockets used by desktops.
Selecting and Installing a Processor
Core 1 Objective 3.4
A hardware technician is sometimes called on to assemble a desktop computer from parts, exchange a processor
that is faulty, add a second processor to a dual-processor system, or upgrade an existing processor to improve performance. In each situation, it is necessary to know how to match a processor for the system in which it is installed.
You also need to know how to install the processor on the motherboard for each of the current Intel and AMD sockets
used for desktop and laptop systems.
Selecting a Processor to Match System Needs
Core 1 Objective 3.4
When selecting the motherboard and processor, recall you must choose between the AMD and Intel chipset and
processor. How to make this decision between the two brands was covered earlier in the text. When selecting a
processor to match a motherboard you already have, the first requirement is to select one that the motherboard
is designed to support. Among the processors the board supports, you need to select the one that best meets the
general requirements of the system and the user’s needs. Here are some processor features to consider:
●● To get the best performance, use the highest-performing processor the board supports. Performance can
be measured by clock speed, the number of tasks a CPU can run per clock cycle, and the size of the processor cache.
Figure 3-6 The M1 processor with ARM-based architecture was

its designs to other companies that use them in their products. Because ARM processors are low cost, low power,
and low heat, they are typically found embedded in mobile devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets.
Companies that use ARM processors include Samsung, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple (see Figure 3-6). ARM
processors can also be found in desktops and servers. One ARM processor claim to fame is that it is used in the
world’s fastest supercomputer.

●● Understand the processor’s ability to multitask, considering the number of cores and multithreading abilities. Know, however, that applications must be able to take advantage of multiple cores. If not, some cores
will sit idly while others do all the work. If the system will only be used for browsing the web, a single-core
processor will do the job. However, Adobe Premier Pro, AutoCAD, The Isle, and Excel are examples of applications that take full advantage of multiple CPU cores.
●● Balance the performance and power of the CPU with that of the entire system. For example, if the system
has a high-performing graphics adapter, don’t install a low-performing processor or hard drive to save on
cost. One bottleneck can slow down the entire system.
●● Be sure to read reviews of the processors you are considering and look for reviews that include comparison benchmarks of several processors. Also, know that you sometimes need to sacrifice performance and
power for cost.
Selecting a Processor
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.4
Your friend, Alice, is working toward her A1 certification. She has decided that the best way to get the experience
she needs before she sits for the exam is to build a system from scratch. She has purchased an ASUS motherboard
and asked you for some help selecting the right processor. She tells you that the system will later be used for light
business needs and she wants to install a processor that is moderately priced to fit her budget. She doesn’t want
to install the most expensive processor the motherboard can support, nor does she want to sacrifice too much
performance or power.
The documentation on the ASUS website (asus.com/us/support) for the ASUS Prime Z490-A motherboard provides this information:
●● The ATX board contains the Z490 chipset and 10th generation LGA1200 socket and uses up to 128 GB of
DDR4 memory.
●● CPUs supported include a long list of 10th generation, 14 nm CPU Core, Pentium, and Celeron processors.
Here are five processors found in this list:
■ Intel Core i7-10700K, 3.8 GHz, 125 W, 16 MB L3 cache, eight cores
■ Intel Core i5-10400T, 2.0 GHz, 35 W, 12 MB L3 cache, six cores
■ Intel Core i3-10300, 3.7 GHz, 65 W, 8 MB L3 cache, four cores
■ Intel Core i3-10100, 3.6 GHz, 65 W, 6 MB L3 cache, four cores
■ Intel Pentium Gold G6400T, 3.4 GHz, 35 W, 4 MB L3 cache, two cores
Based on what Alice has said, you decide to eliminate the most expensive processors (the Core i7 and i5) and
the worst-performing processor (the Pentium Gold). That decision narrows your choices down to a Core i3. Before
you select one of these processors, you need to check the list on the ASUS site to make sure the specific Core i3
processor is included. Look for the exact processor number—for example, the Core i3-10300.
You will also need a cooler assembly. If your processor doesn’t come boxed with a cooler, select a cooler that
fits the processor socket and gets good reviews. You’ll also need some thermal compound if it is not included with
the cooler.
Applying Concepts
The cooler is bracketed to the motherboard using a wire or plastic clip. A creamlike thermal compound is
placed between the bottom of the cooler heat sink and the top of the processor. This compound eliminates air
pockets, helping to draw heat off the processor. The thermal compound transmits heat better than air and makes an
airtight connection between the fan and the processor. When processors and coolers are boxed together, the cooler
heat sink might have thermal compound already applied to the bottom (see Figure 3-7).

Installing a Processor and Cooler Assembly
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Now let’s look at the details of installing Intel and AMD processors and the cooler assembly.
Install an Intel Processor
If you are building a new system and the motherboard
is not already installed in the case, follow the directions of the motherboard manufacturer to install the
motherboard and then the processor, or follow the
directions to install the processor and then the motherboard. The order of installation varies among manufacturers.
Also, a cooler assembly might have nuts, bolts, screws, and plates that must be installed on the motherboard before
you install the motherboard in the case. Here is the general procedure for installations, but always read and follow
the specific directions for your motherboard and cooler assembly during your installation:
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to install
Intel and AMD processors.

gloves to protect the processor,
motherboard, and other components
against ESD.
2. When replacing a processor in an
existing system, power down the
system, unplug the power cord, press
the power button to drain the system of
power, and open the case.
3. For a new motherboard, look for a
protective cover over the processor
socket (see Figure 3-8). Remove this
socket cover and keep it in a safe place.
If you ever remove the processor,
put the cover back on the socket to
protect it.

4. While the socket is exposed, as in Figure 3-9, be very careful not to touch the pins in the socket. Open the
socket by pushing down on the socket lever and gently pushing it away from the socket to lift the lever.
Figure 3-9 The exposed socket is extremely delicate
Lever

5. As you lift the lever, the socket load plate is raised, as shown in Figure 3-10. Notice the two posts
(labeled in Figure 3-11) on either side of the socket next to the hinge. These posts help orient the
processor in the socket.
6. Open the clear plastic protective cover around the processor, and locate the two notches and one gold
triangle that help you orient the processor in the socket. Figure 3-11 shows the posts on the socket that
are used with the notches on the processor to orient the processor in the socket. You can then carefully
remove the plastic cover. While the processor contacts are exposed, take extreme care not to touch
the bottom of the processor. Hold it only at its edges. (It’s best to use antistatic gloves as you work, but
the gloves make it difficult to handle the processor.) Put the processor cover in a safe place, and use it
to protect the processor if you ever remove the processor from the socket.

8. Check carefully to make sure the processor is aligned correctly in the socket. Closing the socket without
the processor fully seated can destroy the socket. Figure 3-13 shows the processor fully seated in the
socket. Close the socket load plate so it catches under the screw head at the front of the socket.
9. Push down on the lever, and gently return it to its locked position.
7. Hold the processor with your index finger and thumb, and orient the processor so that the two notches
on its edge line up with the posts embedded on the socket. Gently lower the processor straight down
into the socket. See Figure 3-12. Don’t allow the processor to tilt, slide, or shift as you put it in the socket.
To protect the pads, the processor needs to go straight down into the socket.

Install the Cooler Assembly
You are now ready to install the cooler. Some coolers are lightweight with heat sinks and a fan on top. Some are
heavier with heat sinks, fins, and a fan on the side, and they require a plate installed on the bottom of the motherboard to strengthen the board for the heavy cooler (see Figure 3-14).

Before installing a cooler, read the directions carefully, and make sure you understand them. The cooler may be
designed for either an Intel or AMD socket and may have to be installed differently depending on the socket type,
so be sure you’re following the correct directions.

For complicated cooler assemblies such as the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO shown in Figure 3-14, look for helpful
YouTube videos that show how to install the assembly.
Note 4
Here are the general steps for installing a cooler assembly:
1. Motherboards with Intel sockets have four holes to anchor the cooler (for example, see Figure 3-15).
Examine the cooler posts that fit over these holes and the clips, nuts, bolts, screws, or plates that will
hold the cooler firmly in place. Make sure you understand how this mechanism works because it may be
difficult to install.
Figure 3-15 If the cooler does not have preapplied thermal compound, apply it on top of the
processor

When removing and reinstalling a processor, use a soft, dry cloth to carefully remove all the old thermal compound
from both the processor and the cooler. Don’t try to reuse the compound.
Note 5
3. Some heavy coolers provide a plate that fits underneath the motherboard, with nuts, bolts, and screws
to secure it to the board. The plate strengthens the board to help protect it from bending when the
heavy cooler is installed. Install the plate, such as the one shown in Figure 3-16. The bolts on top of the
board are now ready to receive the cooler.
2. If the cooler has thermal compound preapplied, remove the plastic from the compound. If the cooler
does not have thermal compound applied, put a small dot of compound (about the size of a small pea)
in the center of the processor, as shown in Figure 3-15. When the cooler is attached and the processor is
running, the compound spreads over the surface. Don’t use too much—apply just enough that will later
create a thin layer. If you use too much compound, it can slide off the housing and damage the processor
or circuits on the motherboard. To get just the right amount, you can buy individual packets that each
contain a single application of thermal compound.

screws as you partially tighten each screw in turn

4. After the plate is installed, install the cooler on top of the processor. Be very careful to place the cooler
straight down on the processor without shifting it so you don’t smear the thermal compound off the top
of the processor. Work very slowly and deliberately. To help keep the cooler balanced and in position,
partly secure screws in two opposite bolts and then into the other two bolts. Rotate among the screws
to partially tighten each one several times and keep the cooler in balance. See Figure 3-17. You can then
clip the fan to the side of the cooler fins.
5. For lighter coolers with locking pins, verify that the locking pins are turned as far as they will go in a
counterclockwise direction. (Make sure the pins don’t protrude into the hollow plastic posts that go
down into the motherboard holes.) Align the cooler over the processor so all four posts fit into the four
holes on the motherboard and the fan power cord can reach the fan header on the motherboard. Then

6. The fan on a cooler receives its power from a 4-pin CPU fan header on the motherboard. Connect
the power cord from the cooler fan to this 4-pin header, which you should find on the board near the
processor (see Figure 3-19).
If you later notice the CPU fan is running far too often, you might need to tighten the connection between the cooler
and the processor.
Note 6

After the processor and cooler are installed and the motherboard is installed in the case, make sure cables and
cords don’t obstruct fans or airflow, especially airflow around the processor and video card. Use cable ties to tie
cords and cables up and out of the way.
Make one last check to verify that all power connectors are in place and that other cords and cables are connected to the motherboard correctly. You are now ready to plug the system back in, turn it on, and verify all is
push down on each locking pin until you hear it pop into the hole. To help keep the cooler balanced
and in position, push down two opposite pins, and then push the remaining two pins in place. Using
a flathead screwdriver, turn each locking pin clockwise to secure it. Figure 3-18 shows a cooler with
locking pins secured. (Later, if you need to remove the cooler, turn each locking pin counterclockwise to
release it from the hole.)

working. If the power comes on (you hear the fan spinning and see lights) but the system fails to work, the processor is most likely not seated solidly in the socket, or some power cord has not yet been connected or is not solidly
connected. Turn everything off, unplug the power cord, press the power button to drain power, open the case, and
recheck your installation.
If the system comes up and begins the boot process but suddenly turns off before the boot is complete, the
processor is most likely overheating because the cooler is not installed correctly. Turn everything off, unplug the
power cord, press the power button to drain power, open the case, and verify that the cooler is securely seated and
connected.
After the system is up and running, you can check BIOS/UEFI setup to verify the system recognized the processor correctly. The setup screen for one processor is shown in Figure 3-20. Also, check the CPU and motherboard
temperatures in BIOS/UEFI setup to verify that CPU is not overheating. In the BIOS/ UEFI utility shown in Figure 3-20,
you can see the temperatures and fan RPMs.

The maximum processor temperature varies by processor; to know the maximum, download the datasheet
specifications for the processor from the Intel website (ark.intel.com). For example, the Intel Core i5-8600K 6-core
processor shown earlier in this module will stop execution if the temperature rises above 100 degrees. If you see
the temperature rising this high, open the case cover and verify the processor fan is running. Perhaps a wire is in
the way and preventing the fan from turning or the fan power wire is not connected. Other troubleshooting tips for
processors are covered in the module “Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer Problems.”
Install an AMD Processor and Cooler Assembly
When installing an AMD Ryzen or Athlon processor, do the following:
1. Open the socket lever. If there’s a protective cover over the socket, remove it.
2. Holding the processor very carefully so you don’t touch the bottom, orient the four empty pin positions
on the bottom with the four filled hole positions in the socket (see Figure 3-21). For some AMD sockets,
a gold triangle on one corner of the processor matches up with a small triangle on a corner of the socket.
Carefully lower the processor straight down into the socket. Don’t allow it to tilt or slide as it goes into
the socket. The pins on the bottom of the processor are very delicate, so take care as you work.

5. You are now ready to apply the thermal compound and install the cooler assembly. For most
AMD sockets, the black retention mechanism for the cooler is already installed on the motherboard
(see Figure 3-23). Set the cooler on top of the processor, aligning it inside the retention
mechanism.

3. Check carefully to make sure the pins in the processor are sitting slightly in the holes. Make sure the
pins are not offset from the holes. If you try to use the lever to put pressure on these pins and they are
not aligned correctly, you can destroy the processor. You can feel the pins settle into place when you’re
lowering the processor into the socket correctly.
4. Press the lever down and gently into position (see Figure 3-22).

Now let’s turn our attention to the various memory technologies used in personal computers and learn how to
upgrade memory.
Memory Technologies
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 3.2
Recall that random access memory (RAM) temporarily holds data and instructions as the CPU processes them and
that the memory modules used on a motherboard are made of dynamic RAM or DRAM. DRAM loses its data rapidly,
and the memory controller must refresh it several thousand times a second. RAM is stored on memory modules,
which are installed in memory slots on the motherboard (see Figure 3-25).
Figure 3-25 RAM on motherboards today is stored in DIMMs

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know the purposes and characteristics of DDR3, DDR4, DDR5, and SO-DIMM
memory technologies and how to match memory for an upgrade to memory already installed in a system.
Several variations of DRAM have evolved over the years. Here are the two major categories of memory modules:
●● All current motherboards for desktops use a type of memory module called a DIMM (dual inline memory
module).
●● Laptops use a smaller version of a DIMM called a SO-DIMM (small outline DIMM, pronounced “sew-dim”).
DIMMs have seen several evolutions, and you need to know about the latest, which are shown in Table 3-1. Notice
the notches on the edge connector of each module, which prevent the wrong type of module from being inserted
into a memory slot on the motherboard.

Many DIMM technologies exist because they have
evolved to improve capacity, speed, and performance
without greatly increasing the cost. A quick Google
search for buying RAM turns up details such as those
shown in Figure 3-26. In this section of the module,
you learn about these technologies so you can make
the best selections of memory for a particular motherboard and customer needs.
We’ll now look at each of the types of DIMM and SO-DIMM modules and the technologies they use.
JEDEC (jedec.org) is the organization responsible for
standards used by solid-state devices, including RAM
technologies.
Note 9
Description of Module Example
A 288-pin DDR5 DIMM is currently the fastest
memory with lower voltage requirements. It
can support quad or dual channels or function
as single DIMMs. It has one notch near the
center of the edge connector.
A 288-pin DDR4 DIMM can support quad or
dual channels or function as single DIMMs.
It has one notch near the center of the edge
connector.
A 240-pin DDR3 DIMM can support quad,
triple, or dual channels or function as single
DIMMs. It has an offset notch.

DIMM and SO-DIMM Technologies
Core 1 Objective 3.2
To understand the details of a memory ad, let’s start with a few important acronyms:
●● The “D” in DIMM stands for “dual,” named for the independent pins on both sides of the module’s edge
connector. All DIMMs have a 64-bit data path.
●● A DDR (Double Data Rate) DIMM gets its name from the fact that it ran twice as fast as earlier DIMMs when
it was invented. It was able to double the effective data rate because a DDR DIMM processes data at the rise
and fall of the motherboard clock beat, rather than at each clock beat.
●● DDR3 uses 240 pins. DDR3 DIMMs are not compatible with other DIMM types because their notches are not
in the same position.
●● DDR4 is faster and uses less power than DDR3. A DDR4 module offers up to 16 Gb DRAM, uses 288 pins, and
has a single notch in the edge connector.
●● DDR5 is faster and uses less power than DDR4. A DDR5 module offers up to 64 Gb DRAM and also uses
288 pins. While the DDR5 has a single notch in the edge connector similar to the DDR4, the DDR5 is not
compatible with DDR4 memory slots because the notch is closer to the center.
Factors that affect the capacity, features, and performance of DIMMs include the number of channels they
use, how much RAM is on one DIMM, the speed, error-checking abilities, and buffering. All these factors are
discussed next.
Single, Dual, Triple, and Quad Channels
Early DIMMs only used a single channel, which means the memory controller can access only one DIMM at a time. To
improve overall memory performance, dual channels allow the memory controller to communicate with two DIMMs at
the same time, effectively doubling the speed of memory access. A motherboard that supports triple channels can access
three DIMMs at the same time, and a quad channel motherboard can access four DIMMs at the same time. DDR3, DDR4,
and DDR5 DIMMs can use dual channels. DDR3 DIMMs can also use triple
channels. DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5
DIMMs can use quad channels. For
dual, triple, or quad channels to
work, the motherboard and the
DIMM must support the technology.
Motherboard manufacturers
typically color-code DIMM slots to
show you how to configure dual, triple, or quad channeling. For example, Figure 3-27 shows how dual
channeling works on a board with
two black DIMM slots and two gray
slots. The board has two memory
channels, channel 1 and channel 2.
With dual channeling, two DIMMs
installed in the two gray slots are
each using a different channel and,
therefore, can be addressed at the
same time. If two more DIMMs are
installed in the two black slots, they
can be accessed at the same time.
Figure 3-27 Using dual channels, the memory controller can read from
two DIMMs at the same time

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to distinguish among single-channel, dual-channel, triple-channel, and
quad-channel memory installations and to configure these installations for best performance.
Figure 3-29 Three identical DDR3 DIMMs installed in a triple-channel configuration
Fourth slot
is empty
When setting up dual channeling, know that the pair of DIMMs to be addressed at the same time must be
equally matched in size, speed, and features, and it is recommended they come from the same manufacturer.
(Two matching DIMMs are often sold as a DIMM kit.) A motherboard that supports dual channels was shown
earlier in Figure 3-25. To use dual channeling, this motherboard requires matching DIMMs to be installed in the
black slots and another matching pair in the blue slots, as shown in Figure 3-28. Know that the second pair of
DIMMs does not have to match the first pair of DIMMs because the blue slots run independently of the black
slots. If the two DIMM slots of the same color are not populated with matching pairs of DIMMs, the motherboard
will revert to single channeling.
For a triple-channel installation, three DIMM slots must be populated with three matching DDR3 DIMMs
(see Figure 3-29). The three DIMMs are installed in the three blue slots on the board. The motherboard in the figure
has a fourth black DIMM slot. You can barely see this black slot behind the three populated slots in the photo. If
the fourth slot is used, then triple channeling is disabled, which can slow down performance. If a matching pair
of DIMMs is installed in the first two slots and another matching pair of DIMMs is installed in the third and fourth
slots, then the memory controller will use dual channels. Dual channels are not as fast as triple channels, but they
are certainly better than single channels.

Expect a motherboard that uses quad channeling to have eight memory slots. For example, the Gigabyte AMD
X399 Gaming motherboard has four DIMM slots on each side of the AMD TR4 processor socket (see Figure 3-30).
The eight DIMM slots support four channels; each channel has two slots. The processor can address four slots or
four channels at the same time. To know which of the eight slots to populate for optimum performance, see the
motherboard user manual; in the figure, the manufacturer did not color-code the slots.

DIMM Speeds
DIMM speeds are measured either in MHz (such as 3000 MHz or 1600 MHz) or PC rating (such as PC4 24000
or PC3 12800). A PC rating is a measure of the total bandwidth (in MB/second) of data moving between the
module and the CPU. To calculate the PC rating for a DDR4 DIMM, multiply the speed by 8 bytes because a
DIMM has an 8-byte or 64-bit data path. For example, a DDR4 DIMM that runs at 3000 MHz has a bandwidth
or transfer rate of 3000 × 8 or 24,000 MB/second, which is expressed as a PC rating of PC4 24000. (A DDR4 PC
rating is labeled PC4.)
A second example calculates the PC rating for a DDR3 DIMM running at 1600 MHz: PC rating = 1600 × 8 = 12,800,
which is written as PC3 12800.
Error Checking
Because DIMMs intended to be used in servers must be extremely reliable, error-checking technology called
ECC (error-correcting code) is sometimes used. Figure 3-31 shows four modules with ECC designed for server use.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be familiar with ECC and non-ECC memory technologies and to know when the
technology is recommended or required in a given scenario.
Figure 3-31 Server memory uses ECC for fault tolerance
Source: Google.com
RAM chips on DIMMs can cause errors if they become undependable and cannot hold data reliably. Sometimes this
happens when chips overheat or power falters.
Note 10
Some DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5 memory modules support ECC. A DIMM that supports ECC will have an extra
chip, the ECC chip. ECC compares bits written to the module to what is later read from the module, and it can
detect and correct an error in a single bit of the byte. If there are errors in 2 bits of a byte, ECC can detect the
error but cannot correct it. The data path width for DIMMs is normally 64 bits, but with ECC, the data path is
72 bits. The extra 8 bits are used for error checking. ECC memory costs more than non-ECC memory, but it is
more reliable. For ECC to work, the motherboard and all installed modules must support it. Also, it’s important
to know that you cannot install a mix of ECC and non-ECC memory on the motherboard—the resulting system
will not work.
As with most other memory technologies discussed in this module, when adding memory to a motherboard, match the type of memory to the type the board supports. To see if your motherboard supports ECC
memory, look for the ability to enable or disable the feature in BIOS/UEFI setup, or check the motherboard
documentation.
Buffered and Registered DIMMs
Buffers and registers hold data and amplify a signal just before the data is written to the module, and they can
increase memory performance in servers. (Buffers are an older technology than registers.) Some DIMMs use buffers, some use registers, and some use neither. If a DIMM doesn’t support registers or buffers, it’s referred to as an
unbuffered DIMM or UDIMM. When looking at advertisements for DIMMs, you might see registered memory written
as RDIMM.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know that DDR4 and DDR3 memory can be found on SO-DIMMs and to know when
to use each type of memory in a given scenario.
Memory Module Description Sample Memory Module
A 2.74″ 260-pin SO-DIMM contains DDR4 memory.
The one notch on the module is offset from the center
of the module.
A 2.66″ 204-pin SO-DIMM contains DDR3 memory.
The one notch on the module is offset from the center
of the module. A DDR3L SO-DIMM uses less power
than a regular DDR3 SO-DIMM.

At the time of this writing, DDR5 SO-DIMM has been
announced, but no timeline has been released for when
it will be available.
Note 13 As with memory modules used in desktop
computers, you can only use the type of memory the
laptop is designed to support. The number of pins and
the position of the notches on a SO-DIMM keep you
from inserting the wrong module in a memory slot.
In memory ads, CAS Latency is sometimes written as CL.
Note 11
When selecting memory, use the memory type that the motherboard manufacturer recommends.
Note 12
CAS Latency
Another memory feature is CAS Latency (CAS stands for “column access strobe”), which is a way of measuring access
timing. The feature refers to the number of clock cycles it takes to write or read a column of data off a memory module.
Lower values are better than higher ones. For example, CL8 is a little faster than CL9.
Ads for memory modules might give the CAS Latency value within a series of timing numbers, such as 5-5-5-15.
The first value is CAS Latency, which means the module is CL5. Looking back at Figure 3-31, you can see the CL rating for the first module is CL22.
Types of Memory Used in Laptops
Today’s laptops use DDR4, DDR3L, or DDR3 SO-DIMM memory. Table 3-2 lists current SO-DIMMs. All these memory
modules are smaller than regular DIMMs and use the same technologies as DIMMs.

Virtual RAM
Core 1 Objective 3.2
Virtual RAM, or virtual memory, is the way Windows uses space on the hard drive to enhance the amount
of RAM in a system. Windows normally stores virtual memory in pagefile.sys, a hidden file stored in
the root directory of drive C:. Windows automatically manages the size of the file, and not having enough
free space on drive C: can cause pagefile.sys to be too small, resulting in a low memory warning. Pagefile
.sys should be able to be at least three times the size of installed RAM.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to configure virtual memory for optimal performance.
Verifying Virtual Memory Settings
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.4
Do the following to check and adjust virtual memory settings:
1. Open the About window in the Settings app, and then click Advanced system settings. The System
Properties dialog box appears with the Advanced tab selected (see Figure 3-32).
Applying Concepts
Figure 3-32 Manage virtual memory using the System Properties dialog box
2. In the Performance section, click Settings. In the Performance Options dialog box, select the Advanced
tab and click Change. The Virtual Memory dialog box appears. See the right side of Figure 3-33.

Automatically manage paging file size for all drives. However, if there is not enough free space
on drive C: for pagefile.sys, you can move the file to another volume. To move the file, uncheck
Automatically manage paging file size for all drives, and select the drive where you want to move the
paging file, as shown in Figure 3-33.
4. Click OK. Windows informs you that you must restart the system for the change to take effect. Click OK to
close the warning box.
5. Click Apply and close all dialog boxes. Then restart the system.

How to Upgrade Memory
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 3.2
To upgrade memory means to add more RAM to a computer. Adding more RAM might solve a problem with slow
performance, applications refusing to load, or an unstable system. When Windows does not have adequate memory
to perform an operation, it displays an “Insufficient memory” error, or it slows down to a painful crawl.
When first purchased, many computers have empty slots on the motherboard, allowing you to add DIMMs or
SO-DIMMs to increase the amount of RAM. Sometimes a memory module goes bad and must be replaced.
When you add more memory to your computer, you need answers to these questions:
●● How much RAM do I need, and how much is currently installed?
●● What type of memory is currently installed?
●● How many and what kind of modules can I fit on my motherboard?
●● How do I select and purchase the right modules for my upgrade?
●● How do I physically install the new modules?
All these questions are answered in the following sections.

How Much Memory Do I Need, and How Much Is Currently Installed?
Core 1 Objective 3.2
With the demands that today’s software places on memory, the answer is probably, “All you can get.” When deciding
how much memory the system can support, consider the limitations of the motherboard, processor, and operating
system. For the motherboard, research the motherboard user manual or manufacturer website. For the processor,
see the Intel or AMD website. Here are the limitations when considering the operating system:
●● Windows requires a minimum of 1 GB for a 32-bit installation and 2 GB for a 64-bit installation, but more is better.
●● For 64-bit installations, Windows 10 Pro can support up to 2 TB of memory.
●● A 32-bit Windows installation can support no more than 4 GB of memory.
How Much and What Kind of Memory Is Currently Installed?
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.2
When you execute msinfo32.exe in Windows, the System Information window shown in Figure 3-34 reports the
amount of installed physical memory. Notice in the window that 8 GB is installed.

Figure 3-35 BIOS/UEFI setup reports the memory configuration and amount
The BIOS/UEFI setup screen shows more information about installed memory than Windows does. Reboot the
computer and access BIOS/UEFI setup, as you learned in the module “All About Motherboards.” The BIOS/UEFI setup
main menu for one system is shown in Figure 3-35. This screen shows that there are four memory slots and that each
contains a 4 GB DIMM. You can also see that the memory speed is 1333 MHz and the board supports dual channeling.
Because all the slots are populated, you know you must replace existing 4 GB DIMMs with larger-capacity
DIMMs, which will increase the price of the upgrade.
On other BIOS/UEFI screens, you should be able to identify the motherboard brand and model. For the BIOS/
UEFI in Figure 3-35, select System Identification Information; you see that the motherboard is the Intel DH67GD.

What Type of Memory Is Already Installed?
Core 1 Objective 3.2
If the board already has memory installed, you want to do your best to match the new modules with the existing
modules. To learn what type of memory modules are already installed, do the following:
1. Open the case and look at the memory slots. How many slots do you have? How many are filled? Remove
each module from its slot, and examine it for the imprinted type, size, and speed. In Figure 3-36, the
module is 4 GB PC4-17000 CL 15-15-15-36, and the brand of RAM is GEIL.

2. If you have not already identified the motherboard, examine it for the imprinted manufacturer and
model (see Figure 3-37).
3. Find the motherboard documentation online, and read it to find the type of memory the board supports.
Look in the documentation to see if the board supports dual channels, triple channels, or quad channels.
If the board supports multiple channels and modules are already installed, verify that matching DIMMs
are installed in each channel, as recommended in the documentation.
4. If you still have not identified the module type, you can take the motherboard and the old memory
modules to a good computer store; the staff there should be able to match it for you.
How Many and What Kind of Modules Can Fit
on My Motherboard?
Core 1 Objective 3.2
Now that you know what memory modules are already installed, you’re ready to decide how much memory and
what kind of modules you can add to the board. Keep in mind that if all memory slots are full, you can sometimes
take out small-capacity modules and replace them with larger-capacity modules, but you can only use the type,
size, and speed of modules that the board can support. Also, if you must discard existing modules, the price of the
upgrade increases.
To know how much memory your motherboard can physically hold, read the documentation that comes with
the board. You can always install DIMMs as single modules, but you might not get the best performance by doing
so. For best performance, install matching DIMMs in each channel (two, three, or four slots). Now let’s look at two
examples, one using dual channels and another using triple channels.
Motherboard Using DDR4 Dual-Channel DIMMs
The ASUS Prime Z370-P motherboard, shown earlier in Figure 3-37, has four 288-pin DDR4 DIMM slots. It supports 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, and 16 GB unbuffered, non-ECC DDR4 DIMMs with dual channeling. DIMM voltage cannot
exceed 1.35 V, and DIMMs with the same CAS Latency must be installed. The user manual recommends installing memory from the same manufacturer and same product line. It also says the maximum speed of the DIMMs
supported varies by the processor. The processor shown in Figure 3-37 is the Intel Core i5-8600K; a quick check
at ark.intel.com tells us that the maximum memory speed supported by this processor is 2666 MHz. The information imprinted on the two DIMMs currently installed (see Figure 3-38) is DDR4 3000 MHz 15-17-17-35 1.35 V

Figure 3-38 Look for imprinted information about a DIMM
You want to upgrade memory from the current 16 GB to 32 GB. To get the full benefit of dual channeling, based
on your research, you need to purchase two matching DIMMs using these specifications:
●● Corsair Vengeance DDR4 DIMM
●● CAS Latency 15, unbuffered, non-ECC
●● Minimum speed of 2666 MHz
To support dual channeling, the two existing DIMMs are installed in the two gray slots on the board; you plan
to install the two new DIMMs in the two black slots.
Motherboard Using DDR3 Triple-Channel DIMMs
The Intel motherboard shown earlier in Figure 3-29 has four DDR3 memory slots that can be configured for single,
dual, or triple channeling. The four empty slots are shown in Figure 3-39. If triple channeling is used, three matching
DIMMs are used in the three blue slots. If the fourth slot is populated, the board reverts to single channeling. For
dual channeling, install two matching DIMMs in the two blue slots farthest from the processor and leave the other
two slots empty. If only one DIMM is installed, it goes in the blue slot in the farthest position from the processor.
Figure 3-39 Four DDR3 slots on a motherboard
The motherboard documentation says that these types of DIMMs can be used:
●● DIMM voltage rating no higher than 1.6 V
●● Non-ECC DDR3 memory
●● Serial Presence Detect (SPD) memory only

●● Gold-plated contacts (some modules use tin-plated contacts)
●● 1333 MHz, 1066 MHz, or 800 MHz (best to match the system bus speed)
●● Unbuffered, nonregistered single- or double-sided DIMMs
●● Up to 16 GB total installed RAM
The third item in the list needs an explanation. SPD is a DIMM technology that declares the module’s size, speed,
voltage, and data path width to system BIOS/UEFI at startup. If the DIMM does not support SPD, the system might
not boot or boot with errors. Today’s memory always supports SPD.
How Do I Select and Purchase the Right Memory Modules?
Core 1 Objective 3.2
You’re now ready to make a purchase. As you select your memory, it might be difficult to find an exact match to
DIMMs already installed on the board. Compromises might be necessary, but understand that there are some you
can make and some you cannot:
●● Mixing unbuffered memory with buffered or registered memory won’t work.
●● When matching memory, you should also match the module manufacturer for best results. But in a pinch,
you can try using memory from two different manufacturers.
●● If you mix memory speeds, know that all modules will perform at the slowest speed.
Now let’s look at how to use a website or computer ad to search for the right memory.
Use a Website to Research Your Purchase
When purchasing memory from a website, such as Crucial Technology’s site (crucial.com) or Kingston Technology’s
site (kingston.com), look for a search utility that will match memory modules to your motherboard. These utilities
are easy to use and help you confirm you have made the right decisions about type, size, and speed to buy. They
can also help if motherboard documentation is inadequate and you’re not exactly sure what memory to buy.
Let’s look at one example on the Crucial site. We are looking to install memory in the ASUS Prime Z370-P motherboard discussed earlier in the module. After selecting the manufacturer, product, and model (see Figure 3-40), click

Note 14
The search results include the DIMMs shown in Figure 3-41. You can see all our criteria are met (unbuffered,
CAS Latency 15, Non-ECC, 3000 MHz, and 1.35 V) except the brand. These criteria validate what we have already
determined based on our research, and we can now search for the matching brand on other memory sites. If we
can’t find the matching brand, this hit will certainly work for our upgrade.

How Do I Install the New Modules?
Core 1 Objective 3.2
When installing RAM modules, be careful to protect the chips against static electricity, as you learned in the module
“Taking a Computer Apart and Putting It Back Together.” Follow these precautions:
●● Always use an ESD strap as you work.
●● Turn off the power, unplug the power cord, press the power button, and remove the case cover.
●● Handle memory modules with care.
●● Don’t touch the edge connectors on the memory module or on the memory slot.
●● Don’t stack cards or modules because this can loosen a chip.
●● Modules usually pop into place easily and are secured by spring catches on both ends. Make sure that
you look for the notches on one side or in the middle of the module; these notches orient the module in
the slot.
Let’s now look at the details of installing a DIMM.
Install DIMMs
For DIMM modules, a small clip latches into place on one side of the slot or two small clips latch into place
on each side of the slot to hold the module in the slot, as shown in Figure 3-42. Some motherboards have only
one latch on the slot. To install a DIMM, first pull the supporting arms on the sides of the slot outward. Look
on the DIMM edge connector for the notches, which help you orient the DIMM correctly over the slot and
insert the DIMM straight down into the slot. When the DIMM is fully inserted, the supporting clips should pop
back into place. Figure 3-43 shows a DIMM being inserted into a slot on a motherboard. Apply pressure on
both ends of the DIMM at the same time, being careful not to rock the module from side to side or backward
and forward.
When the computer powers up, it counts the memory present without any further instruction and senses the
features that the modules support, such as ECC or buffering. During the boot, you can enter BIOS/UEFI to verify that
the memory is recognized or allow Windows to start and use the System Information window to verify the expected
amount of installed memory. If the new memory is not recognized, power down the system and reseat the module.
It’s most likely not installed solidly in the slot.

How to Upgrade Memory on a Laptop
Core 1 Objective 1.1
Before upgrading memory on a laptop, make sure you are not voiding the laptop’s warranty. Search for the best buy,
but make sure you use memory modules made by or authorized by your laptop’s manufacturer and designed for the
exact model of your laptop. Installing generic memory might save money but might also void the laptop’s warranty.
Upgrading memory on a laptop works about the same way as upgrading memory on a desktop: Decide how
much memory you can upgrade and what type of memory you need, purchase the memory, and install it. As with a
desktop computer, be sure to match the type of memory to the type the laptop supports.
Upgrading Memory on a Laptop
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 1.1
Most laptops are designed to allow easy access to memory. Follow these steps to exchange or upgrade memory
for a typical laptop:
1. Back up data and shut down the system. Remove peripherals, including the AC adapter. Remove the
battery. Be sure to use an ESD strap as you work.
2. Many laptops have a RAM compartment on the bottom. For some laptops, this compartment is in the
battery cavity. Turn the laptop over, and loosen the screws on the RAM compartment cover. (It is not
necessary to remove the screws.)

3. Raise the cover (see Figure 3-44), and remove it from its hinges. The two memory slots are exposed.
4. Notice in Figure 3-45 that the SO-DIMM slots are stacked on top of each other. When you remove one SO-DIMM
from the laptop, you can see the slot under it that holds a second SO-DIMM. Also notice in the figure that when
you remove the RAM door, the wireless card is exposed. This easy access to the wireless card makes exchanging
it very easy. To remove a SO-DIMM, pull the clips on the side of the memory slot apart slightly (see Figure 3-45).
The SO-DIMM will pop up and out of the slot and can then be removed. If it does not pop up, you can hold the
clips apart as you pull the module up and out of the slot.

Module Summary
Types and Characteristics of Processors
●● The most important component on the motherboard is the processor, or central processing unit. The two
major manufacturers of processors are Intel and AMD.
●● Processors are rated by their processor speed, lithography, the socket and chipset they can use, multiprocessing features (multithreading, multicore rating, and dual processors), memory cache, memory features
supported, virtualization, overclocking, and processor architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
●● A processor’s memory cache inside the processor housing can be an L1 cache (contained on the processor
die), L2 cache (off the die), and L3 cache (farther from the core than L2 cache).
●● The core of a processor has two arithmetic logic units (ALUs). Multicore processors have two, three, or
more cores (called dual core, triple core, quad core, and so forth). Each core can process two threads at
once if the feature is enabled in BIOS/UEFI setup.
●● The current families of Intel processors for desktops include Core, Pentium, Atom, and Celeron. Several
different processors and generations are within each family.
●● The current AMD desktop and laptop processor families are Ryzen, Ryzen Threadripper, Ryzen with
Graphics, Athlon with Graphics, Ryzen Pro, Athlon Pro, Athlon, and Chromebook. In addition, the Ryzen
Threadripper and Ryzen are the latest processors for desktops. Several processors exist within each family.
●● ARM processors are commonly used in mobile devices.
Selecting and Installing a Processor
●● Select a processor that the motherboard supports. A board is likely to support several processors that vary
in performance and price.
●● When installing a processor, always follow the directions in the motherboard user guide, and be careful to
protect the board and processor against ESD. Current Intel sockets use a socket lever and socket load plate.
When opening these sockets, lift the socket lever and then the socket load plate, install the processor, and
then close the socket. Many AMD sockets have a socket lever but not a socket load plate.
●● Always apply thermal compound between the processor and cooler assembly to help draw heat from the
processor.
Memory Technologies
●● DRAM is stored on DIMMs for desktop computers and SO-DIMMs for laptops.
●● Types of current DIMMs are DDR5 and DDR4, which have 288 pins, and DDR3 DIMMs, which have 240 pins.
●● Matching DIMMs can work together in dual channels, triple channels, and quad channels so the memory
controller can access more than one DIMM at a time to improve performance. In a channel, all DIMMs must
match in size, speed, and features. DDR3 DIMMs can use dual, triple, or quad channeling. DDR 5 DIMMs and
DDR4 DIMMs can use dual or quad channels.
●● DIMM speeds are measured in MHz (for example, 3000 MHz) or PC rating (for example, PC4 24000).
●● The memory controller can check memory for errors and possibly correct them using ECC (error-correcting
code).
●● Buffers and registers are used to hold data and amplify a data signal. A DIMM is rated as a buffered, registered (RDIMM), or unbuffered DIMM (UDIMM).
●● CAS Latency (CL) measures access time to memory. Lower values are faster than higher values.
●● Today’s laptops use DDR4, DDR3L, or DDR3 SO-DIMMs.
●● Virtual RAM is the way Windows uses space on the hard drive to enhance the amount of RAM in a system.
Windows normally stores virtual memory in pagefile.sys.

How to Upgrade Memory
●● When upgrading memory, use the type, size, and speed the motherboard supports, and match new modules
to those already installed. Features to match include DDR5, DDR4, DDR3, size in MB or GB, speed (MHz or PC
rating), buffered, registered, unbuffered, CL rating, tin or gold connectors, support for dual, triple, or quad
channeling, ECC, and non-ECC. Using memory made by the same manufacturer is recommended.
●● When upgrading components on a laptop, including memory, use components that are the same brand as
the laptop, or use only components recommended by the laptop’s manufacturer.

Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.4
To identify your motherboard and find out what processor and processor socket a motherboard is currently using,
you can use BIOS/UEFI setup, Windows utilities, or third-party software such as Speccy at ccleaner.com/speccy. To
research which processors a board can support, you can use the motherboard user guide, the website of the motherboard manufacturer, and, for Intel processors, the Intel site at ark.intel.com. Research the current processor and
processor socket of your computer’s motherboard, research which processors your board can support, and answer
the following questions:
1. What is the brand and model of your motherboard? What processor socket does it use? How did you find
your information?
2. Identify the currently installed processor, including its brand, model, speed, and other important
characteristics. How did you find your information?
3. List three or more processors the board supports, according to the motherboard documentation or
website.
4. Search the web for three or more processors that would match this board. Save or print three webpages
that show the details and prices of a high-performing, moderate-performing, and low-performing processor
the board supports.
5. If your current processor fails, which processor would you recommend for this system? Explain your
recommendation.
Now assume the processor is Core i5-11500, and it has gone bad. The motherboard in which it is installed is the
ASUS Prime Z590-PLUS desktop board. The owner of the motherboard has requested that you keep the replacement
cost as low as possible without sacrificing too much performance. What processor would you recommend for the

Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.2
Research your own computer or a lab computer to determine how much and what type of memory is currently
installed and how much the system can support. Then research on the web to determine the total cost of a memory
upgrade so you can max out the total memory on your system. Consider the maximum memory your motherboard,
processor, and operating system can support. You can keep the cost down by using the modules you already have,
but don’t forget to match important features of the modules already installed. Save or print webpages from two
retail sites that show modules you would purchase. Answer the following questions:
1. How much memory is currently installed? After the upgrade, how much memory would be installed?
2. Which component—the motherboard, processor, or OS—dictated the maximum memory that could be
installed in your system?
3. Describe the details of the currently installed memory. Describe the details of the new memory you would
purchase for the upgrade.
4. How much will the upgrade cost?

Upgrading Laptop Memory
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 1.1
A friend, Tangela, is looking for ways to improve the performance of her Windows Lenovo laptop and has turned to
you for advice. She has cleaned up the hard drive and is now considering the possibility of upgrading memory. In a
phone conversation, Tangela reported the following:
1. When she opened the System Information window, she saw 8.0 GB as Installed Physical Memory.
2. When she looked on the bottom of the laptop, she saw the model “IdeaPad 310-15ABR.”
3. When she opened a cavity cover on the bottom of the case, she discovered one SO-DIMM slot filled with a
SO-DIMM that has “4GB PC4-2400T” imprinted on it.
Tangela is now puzzled why Windows reports 8 GB of memory, but the one SO-DIMM contains only 4 GB. With
this information in hand, research the possible upgrade and answer the following:
1. Explain why Windows reports 8 GB of memory even though the one SO-DIMM contains 4 GB of memory.
2. Can the laptop receive a memory upgrade? Save or print a webpage showing a SO-DIMM that can fit the
system. How much will the upgrade cost?

Introduction
In the first modules of this text, you learned about the motherboard, processor, and RAM. This module focuses on
how to keep these heat-producing components cool by using fans, heat sinks, and other cooling devices and methods. You also learn about one more essential component of a computer system, the power supply, including how to
select a power supply to meet the wattage needs of a system.
Then we focus on troubleshooting these various hardware subsystems and components. You study the troubleshooting techniques and procedures to get the full picture of what it’s like to have the tools and knowledge in hand
to solve any computer-related problem. Then you learn to practically apply these skills to troubleshooting the
electrical system, motherboard, processor, and memory. By the end of this module, you should feel confident that
you can face a problem with hardware and understand how to zero in on the source of the problem and its solution.
Cooling Methods and Devices
Core 1 Objective 3.4
The processor, motherboard, memory modules, expansion cards, and other components in the case produce heat.
If they get overheated, the system can become unstable, and components can fail or be damaged. As a hardware
technician, you need to know how to keep a system cool. Devices that are used to keep a system cool include CPU
fans, case fans, coolers, heat sinks, and liquid cooling systems.
In this section of the module, you learn about several methods to keep the system cool, beginning with these
general rules to cool the inside of a computer case:
●● Keep the case closed. This may seem counterintuitive, as you might think an open case allows for better
airflow, but consider the dust that will clog your fans and how fans are designed to draw hot air out of a
closed case. If airflow is disrupted, an open case is a temporary fix to an overheating computer and should
not be used long term.
●● Clean the inside of the computer. Dust and debris clog your computer. Dirt and dust cake on the equipment and essentially insulate the heat-sensitive components. Use a can of compressed air to blow clean the
inside of the case and its components.
●● Move the computer. If the computer is in a fairly dusty or warm space, the computer might overheat. If
overheating is a problem, try moving the computer to a new area that is cleaner and cooler.
Processor Coolers, Fans, and Heat Sinks
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Because a processor generates so much heat, computer systems use a cooling assembly designed for a specific
processor to keep temperatures below the processor maximum temperature. If a processor reaches its maximum
temperature, it automatically shuts down. Good processor coolers maintain a temperature of 90–110 degrees
Fahrenheit (32–43 degrees Celsius). The cooler (see Figure 4-1) sits on top of the processor and consists of a fan and

a heat sink, which is made of metal and draws the heat
away from the processor into the fins. The fan can then
blow the heat away. You learned to install a cooler in the
module “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory.”
A cooler is made of aluminum, copper, or a combination of both. Copper is more expensive but does a
better job of conducting heat. For example, the Thermaltake (thermaltakeusa.com) multisocket cooler shown in
Figure 4-2 is made of copper and has an adjustable fan
control.
To get its power, the cooler fan power cord connects
to a 4-pin fan header on the motherboard (see Figure 4-3).
The fan connector will have three or four holes. A threehole connector can fit onto a 4-pin header; just ignore
the last pin. A 4-pin header on the motherboard supports
pulse width modulation (PWM), which controls fan speed
in order to reduce the overall noise in a system. If you use
a cooler fan power cord with three pins, know that the
fan will always operate at the same speed.

a multisocket cooler that fits several
Intel and AMD sockets

Thermal Compound and Thermal Pads
Core 1 Objective 3.4
Recall that the cooler is bracketed to the motherboard using a wire or plastic clip, and thermal compound is placed
between the bottom of the cooler heat sink and the top of the processor. Thermal compound, also called thermal
paste or thermal grease, is essential to effectively transfer heat by completely filling the gap between the processor
and the cooling device. There are microscopic ridges on the surface of the contact plate on each component. The
gel-like paste spreads in a thin layer to fill the gaps created by those ridges, removing air pockets that are inefficient
at conducting heat.
An alternative to thermal paste is a thermal pad. A thermal pad is thicker than thermal paste and therefore fills
larger gaps better. However, because thermal pads are less malleable, they still allow for air gaps. Thermal pads are
more easily applied and are sized for the contact plate. Never use thermal pads and thermal compound at the same
time, and never stack thermal pads together. Reusing thermal pads is not recommended.

A computer case might need as many as seven or eight
fans mounted inside the case; however, the trend is to use
fewer and larger fans. Generally, large fans tend to perform
better and run more quietly than small fans.
Processors and video cards, also called graphics cards,
are the two greatest heat producers in a system. Some
graphics cards come with a fan on the side of the card.
You can also purchase heat sinks and fans to mount on an
expansion card to keep it cool. Another solution is to use
a fan card mounted next to the graphics card. Figure 4-5
shows a PCI fan card. Be sure you select a fan card that fits
the expansion slot you plan to use, and make sure there’s
enough clearance beside the graphics card for the fan card
to fit and for airflow.
For additional cooling, consider a RAM cooler such as
the one shown in Figure 4-6. It clips over a DIMM. A fan
might be powered by a SATA power connector or 4-pin
Molex power connector. The fan shown in Figure 4-6 uses a Molex connector. If you need a different or extra power
connector that isn’t available on a power supply, you can use an adapter to change an unused SATA or Molex connector into the connector you need.
When selecting any fan or cooler, take into consideration the added noise level and the ease of installation.
Some coolers and fans can use a temperature sensor that controls the fan. Also consider the guarantee made by the
cooler or fan manufacturer.

Temperature ratings show that thermal compound is generally better than thermal pads at conducting heat transfer
and maintaining cooler temperatures for the processor.
Note 1
Case Fans, Other Fans, and Heat Sinks
Core 1 Objective 3.4
To prevent overheating, you can also install additional case fans. Most cases have one or more positions to hold a
case fan to help draw air out of the case. Figure 4-4 shows holes on the rear of a case designed to hold a case fan.

Liquid Cooling Systems
Core 1 Objective 3.4
In addition to using fans, heat sinks, and
thermal compound to keep a processor cool,
a liquid cooling system can be used. For the
most part, these systems are used by hobbyists attempting to overclock to the max
a processor in a gaming computer because
those types of high-powered systems tend to
run hot. Liquid cooling systems tend to run
more quietly than other cooling methods.
They might include a PCIe card that has a
power supply, temperature sensor, and processor to control the cooler.
In a liquid cooling system, a small pump
sits inside the computer case, and tubes
move liquid around components and then
away from them to a place where fans can
cool the liquid, similarly to how a car radiator works. Figure 4-7 shows one liquid cooling system where the liquid is cooled by fans
sitting inside a large case. Sometimes, however, the liquid is pumped outside the case,
where it is cooled.
Now let’s turn our attention to the power
supply.

Types and Characteristics of Power
Supplies
Core 1 Objective 3.5
As you select the right power supply for a system, you need
to be aware of the following power supply features:
●● ATX or microATX form factor. The form factor of a
power supply determines the dimensions of the power
supply and the placement of screw holes and slots used
to anchor the power supply to the case.
●● Wattage ratings. A power supply has a wattage rating
for total output maximum load (for example, 500 W,
Core 1 Objective 3.5
In the module “Taking a Computer Apart and Putting It Back
Together,” you learned about the different types of power connectors and how to uninstall and install a power supply unit
(PSU). You might need to replace a power supply when it fails
or if the power supply in an existing system is not adequate.
When building a new system, you can purchase a computer
case with the power supply already installed (see Figure 4-8),
or you can purchase a power supply separate from the case.
850 W, or 1000 W) and individual wattage ratings for each of the voltage output circuits. These wattage
capacities are listed in the documentation and on the side of a power supply, as shown in Figure 4-9.
When selecting a power supply, pay particular attention to the capacity for the 112 V rail. (A “rail” is
the term used to describe each circuit provided by the power supply.) The 112 V rail is the one most used,
especially in high-end gaming systems. Notice in Figure 4-9 that the 112 V rail gets 360 W of the maximum
525 W load. Sometimes you need to use a power supply with a higher-than-needed overall wattage to get
enough wattage on this one rail.

●● Fans inside the PSU. Every power supply has a fan inside its case; some have
two fans. The fan may be mounted on
the back or top of the PSU. Fans range
in size from 80 mm to 150 mm wide. The
larger the fan, the better it is at cooling, and the quieter it runs. Some PSUs
can automatically adjust the fan speed
based on the internal temperature of
the system.
●● Number and type of connectors. Consider the number and type of power cables and connectors the unit
provides. Connector types are shown in Table 1-2 in the module “Taking a Computer Apart and Putting It
Back Together.” Table 4-1 lists some common connectors and the voltages they supply. A modular power
supply includes detached power cables, sometimes called modular cable systems, that you can plug into
connectors on the side of the unit. By using only the power cables you need, you eliminate unnecessary
power cables, which can obstruct airflow inside the computer case.
To calculate wattage, know that the power in watts (W) is equal to the current in amps (A) times the voltage in
volts (V): W 5 A 3 V.

24-pin P1 13.3 V, 15 V, 612 V Newer main power connector to motherboard
Table 4-1 Power supply connectors and voltages
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know the voltage output of the power connectors listed in Table 4-1. Consider
memorizing the table.
If a power supply doesn’t have the connector you need, you can probably buy an adapter to convert one connector
to another. For example, Figure 4-10 shows an adapter that converts an older 20-pin connector to the newer 24-pin
motherboard connector. Without this adapter, the motherboard would likely fry if you plugged a 20-pin cable into a
24-pin motherboard connector when the motherboard is drawing the full power of a 24-pin cable.
Note 3
Some power supplies are designed without
fans so they can be used in home theater
systems or other areas where quiet operation is a requirement.

●● Dual voltage options. Expect a power supply to have a dual-voltage selector switch on the back where you
can switch input voltage in the range 110 to 120 V AC for the United States or in the range 220 to 240 V AC
for other countries.
●● Extra features. Consider the warranty of the power supply, the overall quality, and extra features based on
the needs of the user:
■ Some power supplies are designed to support two video cards used in a gaming computer. Two
technologies used for multiple video cards are SLI by NVIDIA and Crossfire by AMD. If you plan to use
multiple video cards, use a PSU that supports SLI or Crossfire.
■ Know that more expensive power supplies are quieter, last longer, and don’t put off as much
heat as less expensive ones. Also, expect a good power supply to protect the system against
overvoltage.
■ A power supply rated with Active PFC
(power factor correction) runs more
efficiently and uses less electricity
than other power supplies.
Commonly used with equipment found in
server racks—and sometimes in high-end computers—a redundant power supply ensures
there is no interruption in power. A redundant
power supply (RPS) uses two identical power
supplies, as shown in Figure 4-11. Only one of
the power supplies is used at a time, and both
are capable of supplying the full power requirements of the equipment. In the event that one
power supply fails, the transition to the other is
seamless to prevent any disruption to power to
essential devices.
How to Calculate Wattage Capacity
Core 1 Objective 3.5
When deciding what wattage capacity you need for the power supply, consider the total wattage requirements
of all components inside the case as well as USB devices that get their power from ports connected to the
motherboard.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to select and install a power supply. You need to know how to decide
on the wattage, connectors, and form factor of the power supply.
Figure 4-11 A redundant power supply uses two identical
power supply units
Source: amazon.com, Inc.
Keep these two points in mind when selecting the correct wattage capacity for a power supply:
●● Video cards draw the most power. Video cards draw the most power in a system, and they draw from the
112 V output. If your system has a video card, pay particular attention to the 112 V rating. The current
trend is for the motherboard to provide the video components and video port, thus reducing the overall
wattage needs for a system. Video cards are primarily used in gaming computers or other systems that
require high-quality graphics.

PCIe 316 video card 150–300 W
PCIe 316 card other than a video card 100 W
Table 4-2 To calculate the power supply rating you need, add up total wattage
●● The power supply should be rated about 30% higher than expected needs. Power supplies that run at less
than peak performance last longer and don’t overheat. In addition, a power supply loses some of its capacity over time. Also, don’t worry about a higher-rated power supply using too much electricity. Components
only draw what they need. For example, a power supply rated at 1000 W and running at a 500 W draw will
last longer and give off less heat than a power supply rated at 750 W and running at a 500 W draw.
To know what size of power supply you need, add
up the wattage requirements of all components, and
then add 30%. Technical documentation for these components should give you the information you need.
Table 4-2 lists appropriate wattage ratings for common
devices. Alternately, you can use a wattage calculator
provided on the website of many manufacturers and
vendors. Using the calculator, you enter the components in your system, and then the calculator will recommend the wattage you need for your power supply.
Table 4-3 lists a few case and power supply
manufacturers.
Caution
Some older Dell motherboards and power supplies do
not use the standard P1 pinouts for ATX, although the
power connectors look the same. For this reason, never
use a Dell power supply with a non-Dell motherboard or
a Dell motherboard with a non-Dell power supply without
first verifying that the power connector pinouts match;
otherwise, you might destroy the power supply, the
motherboard, or both.

So far in the text, you have learned about motherboards, processors, RAM, and the electrical system, which are
the principal hardware components of a computer. With this hardware foundation in place, you’re ready to learn
about computer troubleshooting. Let’s start with an overview of how to approach any hardware problem, and then
we’ll turn our attention to the details of troubleshooting the electrical system, motherboard, RAM, and CPU.
Strategies to Troubleshoot Any
Computer Problem
Core 1 Objective 5.1
When a computer doesn’t work and you’re responsible for fixing it, you should generally approach the problem first
as an investigator and discoverer, always being careful not to compound the problem through your actions. If the
problem seems difficult, see it as an opportunity to learn something new. Ask questions until you understand the
source of the problem. Once you understand it, you’re almost done because the solution most likely will be evident.
If you take the attitude that you can understand the problem and solve it, no matter how deeply you must dig, you
probably will solve it.
One systematic method used by most expert troubleshooters to solve a problem comprises the six steps diagrammed in Figure 4-12, which can apply to both software and hardware problems. As an IT technician, expect that
you will develop your own style and steps for troubleshooting based on your own experiences over time.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about all the aspects of troubleshooting theory and strategy and how to apply
the troubleshooting procedures and techniques described in this section. Read A1 Core 1 Objective 5.1, and compare
it with Figure 4-12. You’ll find the objectives with this text.
Here are the steps:
1. Interview the user and back up data before you make any changes to the system.
2. Examine the system, analyze the problem, and make an initial determination of the source of the
problem.
3. Test your theory. If the theory is not confirmed, form another theory or document what you’ve
discovered so far. If you have run out of ideas, escalate the problem to someone higher in your
organization with more experience or resources.
4. After you know the source of the problem, plan what to do to fix the problem, and then fix it.
5. Verify that the problem is fixed and that the system works. Take any preventive measures to make sure
the problem doesn’t happen again.
6. Document activities, outcomes, and what you learned.
Over time, a good IT support technician builds a strong network of resources they can count on when solving
computer problems. Here are some resources to help you get started with your own list of reliable and time-tested
sources of assistance:
●● The web. Do a web search on an error message, a short description of the problem, or the model and manufacturer of a device to get help. Check out the website of the product manufacturer or search a support
forum. It’s likely that other technicians have encountered the same problem and posted the question and

answer. If you search and cannot find your answer, you can post a new question. Youtube.com videos might
help. Many technicians enjoy sharing online what they know, but be careful—not all technical advice found
online is correct or well intentioned.
●● Chat, forums, or email technical support. Support from hardware and software manufacturers can help
you interpret an error message or provide general support in diagnosing a problem. Most technical support is available during working hours by way of an online chat session. Support from the manufacturer is
considered the highest authority for the correct fix to a problem.

●● User manuals. Refer to the user manuals, which often list error messages and their meanings. They also
might contain a troubleshooting section and list any diagnostic tools available.
●● Technical associates in your organization. Be sure to ask for advice when you’re stuck. Also, after making a
reasonable and diligent effort to resolve a problem, getting the problem fixed could become more important
than resolving it yourself. There comes a time when you might need to turn the problem over to a technician who is more experienced or has access to more resources. (In an organization, this process is called
escalating the problem.)
Now let’s examine the process step by step. As you learn about these six steps, you’ll also learn about 13 rules
useful when troubleshooting. Here’s the first rule.
Rule 1: Approach the Problem Systematically
When trying to solve the problem, start at the beginning and walk through the situation in a thorough, careful way.
This rule is invaluable. Remember it and apply it every time. If you don’t find the explanation to the problem after one
systematic walk-through, then repeat the entire process. Check and double-check to find the step you overlooked the
first time. Most problems with computers are simple, such as a loose cable or incorrect Windows setting. Computers
are logical through and through. Whatever the problem is, it’s also very logical. Also, if you are faced with more than
one problem on the same computer, work on only one problem at a time. Trying to solve multiple problems at the
same time can get too confusing.
Always check compatibility between utility software and the operating system (OS) you plan to use. Check with the
computer owner before installing any new software.

which is available for download from their websites. For example, you can download Seagate Toolkit (to back
up data), SeaTools for Windows (must be installed in Windows), or SeaTools Bootable (to create a bootable
USB drive) and use the software to diagnose and fix problems with Seagate drives. See Figure 4-13. Search
the support section of a manufacturer’s website to find diagnostic software and guidelines for using it.

1. Please describe the problem. What error messages, unusual displays, or failures did you see? (Possible
answer: I see this blue screen with a funny-looking message on it that makes no sense to me.)
2. When did the problem start? Does the computer have a history of similar problems? (Possible answer:
When I first booted after loading this neat screen saver I downloaded from the web.)
3. What was the situation when the problem occurred? (Possible answers: I was trying to start up my
laptop. I was opening a document in Microsoft Word. I was using the web to research a project.)
4. What programs or software were you using? (Possible answer: I was using Microsoft Edge.)
5. What changes have recently been made to the system? For example, did you recently install new
hardware or software or move your computer system? (Possible answer: Well, yes. Yesterday I moved
the computer case across the room.)
6. Has there been a recent thunderstorm or electrical problem? (Possible answer: Yes, last night. Then
when I tried to turn on my computer this morning, nothing happened.)
7. Have you made any hardware, software, or configuration changes? Have there been any infrastructure
changes? (Possible answer: No, but I think my sister might have.)
8. Has someone else used your computer recently? (Possible answer: Sure, my son uses it all the time.)
9. Is there some valuable data on your system that is not backed up that I should know about before I start
working on the problem? (Possible answer: Yes! Yes! My term paper! It’s not backed up! You have to save that!)
10. Can you show me how to reproduce the problem? (Possible answer: Yes, let me show you what to do.)
Based on the answers you receive, ask more penetrating questions until you feel the user has given you all the
information that might help you solve the problem. As you talk with the user, keep in mind rules 2, 3, and 4.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to interact with a user and know what questions to ask in a troubleshooting scenario without accusing or disrespecting the user.
Rule 2: Establish Your Priorities
This rule can help make for a satisfied customer. Decide what your first priority is. For example, it might be to recover
lost data or to get the computer back up and running as soon as possible. When practical, ask the user or customer for
help deciding on priorities. For most users, data is the first priority unless they have a recent backup.
Step 1: Interviewing the User and Backing Up Data
Core 1 Objective 5.1
Every troubleshooting situation begins with interviewing the user if possible. If you have the opportunity to speak
with the user, ask questions to help you identify the problem, how to reproduce it, and possible sources of the
problem. Also ask about any data on the hard drive that is not backed up.
Rule 3: Beware of User Error
Remember that many problems stem from user error. If you suspect this is the case, ask the user to show you the
problem and carefully watch what the user is doing. Be careful to handle a user error delicately because some people
don’t like to hear that they made a mistake.

After you have talked with the user, be sure to back up any important data that is not currently backed up before
you begin work on the computer. Here are three options:
●● Use Explorer to copy the data to another system. If the computer is working well enough to boot to the
Windows desktop, you can use Windows File Explorer to copy data to a flash drive, another computer on
the network, or other storage media.
●● Move the hard drive to another system. If the computer is not healthy enough to use Explorer, don’t do
anything to jeopardize the data. If you must take a risk with the data, let it be the user’s decision to do so,
not yours. When a system won’t boot from the hard drive, consider removing the drive and installing it as
a second drive in a working system. If the file system on the problem drive is intact, you might be able to
copy data from the drive to the primary drive in the working system.
To move the hard drive to a working computer, you don’t need to physically install the drive in the
drive bay. Open the computer case. Carefully lay the drive on the case and connect a power cord and data
cable (see Figure 4-14). Then turn on the computer. While you have the computer turned
on, be very careful not to touch the drive or
touch inside the case. Also, while a tower case
is lying on its side like the one in Figure 4-14,
don’t use the optical drive.
Start the computer and sign in to Windows using an Administrator account. (If you
don’t sign in with an Administrator account,
you must provide the password to an Administrator account before you can access the files
on the newly connected hard drive.) When
Windows finds the new drive, it assigns a drive
letter. Use Explorer or third-party software to
copy files from this drive to the primary hard
drive in this system or to other storage media.
Then return the drive to the original system
and turn your attention to solving the original
problem.
Figure 4-14 Move a hard drive to a working computer
to recover data on the drive
An easier way to temporarily install a hard drive in a system is to use a USB port. Figure 4-15 shows a USB-to-SATA
converter kit. The SATA connector can be used for desktop or laptop hard drives because a SATA connector is the same
for both. A USB-to-SATA converter is handy when recovering data and troubleshooting problems with hard drives that
refuse to boot.
Note 6
Rule 4: Keep Your Cool and Don’t Rush
In some situations, you might be tempted to act too quickly and to be drawn into the user’s sense of emergency. But
keep your cool and don’t rush. For example, if a computer stops working and unsaved data is still in memory or if data
on the hard drive has not been backed up, look and think carefully before you leap! A wrong move can be costly. The
best advice is refrain from hurrying. Carefully plan your moves. Research the problem using documentation or the web
if you’re not sure what to do, and don’t hesitate to ask for help. Don’t simply try something, hoping it will work, unless
you’ve run out of more intelligent alternatives!

●● Hire a professional file recovery service. If your data is extremely valuable and other methods have failed,
you might want to consider a professional data recovery service. They’re expensive but may be worth it
if getting the data back is a high priority. To find a service, do a web search on “data recovery.” Before
selecting a service, be sure to read reviews, understand the warranty and guarantees, and perhaps get a
recommendation from a satisfied customer.
If possible, have the user verify that all important data is safely backed up before you continue to the next
troubleshooting step.
Figure 4-15 Use a USB-to-SATA converter to recover data from a drive that has
a SATA connector
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know the importance of making backups before you make changes to a system.
Caution
Don’t take chances with a user’s important data. If the user tells you the data has already been backed up, ask them
to verify that they can recover the data from the backup website or media before you assume the data is safely
backed up.
If you’re new to troubleshooting and don’t want the user looking over your shoulder while you work, you might
want to let them know you’d prefer to work alone. You can say something like, “Okay, I think I have everything I need
to get started. I’ll let you know if I have another question.”

Follow this process to form your best guess (best theory) and test it:
1. Reproduce the problem and observe for yourself what the user has described. For example, if the
user tells you the system is totally dead, find out for yourself. Plug in the power and turn on the system.
Listen for fans and look for lights and error messages. Suppose the user tells you that Microsoft Edge
will not open. Try opening it yourself to see what error messages might appear. As you investigate
the system, refrain from making changes until you’ve come up with your theory for the source of the
problem. Can you duplicate the problem? Intermittent problems are generally more difficult to solve
than problems that occur consistently.
2. Decide if the problem is hardware or software related. Sometimes you might not be sure, but make
your best guess. For example, if the system fails before Windows starts to load, chances are the problem
is a hardware problem. If the user tells you the system has not worked since the lightning storm the
night before, chances are the problem is electrical. If the problem is that Explorer will not open even
though the Windows desktop loads, you can assume the problem is software related. In another example,
suppose a user complains that their Word documents are getting corrupted. Possible sources of the
problem might be that the user does not know how to save documents properly, the application or the
OS might be corrupted, the computer might have a virus, or the hard drive might be intermittently failing.
Investigate for yourself, and then decide if the problem is caused by software, hardware, or the user.
3. Make your best guess as to the source of the problem, and don’t forget to question the obvious. Here
are some practical examples of questioning the obvious and checking the simple things first:
●● The video doesn’t work. Your best guess is the monitor cables are loose or the monitor is not turned on.
●● Excel worksheets are getting corrupted. Your best guess is the user is not saving the workbook files
correctly.
●● The DVD drive is not reading a DVD. Your best guess is the DVD is scratched.
●● The system refuses to boot and displays the error that the hard drive is not found. Your best guess is
internal cables to the drive are loose.
Rule 6: Try the Simple Things First
The solutions to most problems are so simple and obvious that we overlook them because we expect the problem to
be difficult. Don’t let the complexity of computers fool you. Most problems are easy to fix. Really, they are! To save time,
check the simple things first, such as whether a power switch is not turned on or a cable is loose. Generally, it’s easy
to check for a hardware problem before you check for a software problem. For example, if a USB drive is not working,
verify that the drive works on another port or another computer before verifying the drivers are installed correctly.
Rule 5: Make No Assumptions
This rule is the hardest to follow because there is a tendency to trust anything in writing and assume that people are
telling you exactly what happened. But documentation is sometimes wrong, and people don’t always describe events
as they occurred, so do your own investigating. For example, if the user tells you that the system boots up with no
error messages but that the software still doesn’t work, boot for yourself. You never know what the user might have
overlooked.
Step 2: Examining the System and Making Your Best Guess
Core 1 Objective 5.1
You’re now ready to start solving the problem. Rules 5 and 6 can help.

If you’re having trouble deciding what might be the source of the problem, keep rule 7 in mind, and try searching
these resources for ideas and tips:
1. The specific application, operating system, or hardware you support must be available to you to test,
observe, and study and to use to recreate a customer’s problem whenever possible.
2. Verify any system or application changes by referring to the system or application event logs. Windows
keeps comprehensive logs about the system, hardware, applications, and user activities; these logs
can be viewed using Windows Event Viewer. Many applications keep logs of events or changes to the
system or application. Some applications might pop up error messages, such as a low-disk-space error.
Open the application log to evaluate the error more closely and to see if any more details are provided
in the log.
3. Use a search engine to search the web for help. In your search string, include an error message,
symptom, hardware device, or description of the problem. The chances are always good that someone
else has had the same problem and has written about it online, and that someone else has presented
a step-by-step solution. All you have to do is find it! As you practice this type of web research, you’ll get
better and better at knowing how to form a search string and knowing which websites are trustworthy
and present the best information. If your first five minutes of searching doesn’t turn up a solution, please
don’t give up! It might take patience and searching for 20 minutes or more to find the solution you need.
As you search, you’ll most likely learn more and more about the problem, and you’ll slowly zero in on
a solution.
Rule 7: Become a Researcher
Following this rule is the most fun. When a computer problem arises that you can’t easily solve, be as tenacious as a
bulldog. Search the web, ask questions, read more, make some phone calls, and ask more questions. Take advantage
of every available resource, including online help, documentation, technical support, and books such as this one. Learn
to perform advanced searches using a good search engine on the web, such as google.com. What you learn will be
yours to take to the next problem. This is the real joy of computer troubleshooting. If you’re good at it, you’re always
learning something new.
To limit your search to a particular site when using google.com, use the site: parameter in the search box. For example,
to search only the Microsoft site for information about the defrag command, enter this search string:
defrag site:microsoft.com
Note 7
4. Some companies offer an expert system for troubleshooting. An expert system is software that is
designed and written to help solve problems. It uses databases of known facts and rules to simulate
human experts’ reasoning and decision making. Expert systems for IT technicians work by posing
questions about a problem to be answered by the technician or the customer. The response to each
question triggers another question from the software until the expert system arrives at a possible
solution or solutions. Many expert systems are “intelligent,” meaning the system will record your input
and use it in subsequent sessions to select more questions to ask and approaches to try. Therefore,
future troubleshooting sessions on the same type of problem tend to zero in more quickly toward
a solution.

Most computer problems are simple and can be simply solved, but you do need a game plan. That’s how
Figure 4-16 can help. The flowchart focuses on problems that affect the boot. As you work your way through it, you’re
eliminating one major computer subsystem after another until you zero in on the problem. After you’ve discovered
the problem, the solution is often obvious.
As Figure 4-16 indicates, troubleshooting a computer problem is divided into problems that occur during the
boot and those that occur after the Windows Start screen or desktop has successfully loaded. Problems that occur
during the boot might happen before Windows starts to load or during Windows startup. Read the flowchart in
Figure 4-16 very carefully to get an idea of the symptoms that would cause you to suspect each subsystem.
Rule 9: Write Things Down
Keep good notes as you’re working. Notes will help you think more clearly. Draw diagrams. Make lists. Clearly and precisely write down what you’re learning. If you need to leave the problem and return to it later, it’s difficult to remember
what you have observed and already tried. When the problem gets cold like this, your notes will be invaluable.
Rule 10: Don’t Assume the Worst
When it’s an emergency and your only copy of data is on a hard drive that is not working, don’t assume that the data
is lost. Much can be done to recover data. If you want to recover lost data on a hard drive, don’t write anything to the
drive; you might write on top of lost data, eliminating chances of recovery.
Rule 11: Reboot and Start Over
This is an important rule. Fresh starts are good, and they uncover events or steps that might have been overlooked.
Take a break! Get away from the problem. Begin again.
Rule 8: Divide and Conquer
This rule is the most powerful. Isolate the problem. In the overall system, remove one hardware or software component after another until the problem is isolated to a small part of the whole system. As you divide a large problem into
smaller components, you can analyze each component separately. You can use one or more of the following to help
you divide and conquer:
●● In Windows, perform a clean boot to eliminate all nonessential startup programs and services as a possible
source of the problem.
●● Boot from a bootable DVD or flash drive to eliminate the Windows installation and the hard drive as the
problem.
●● Remove any unnecessary hardware devices, such as a second video card, optical drive, or even the hard drive.
You don’t need to physically remove the optical drive or hard drive from the bays inside the case. Simply
disconnect the data cable and the power cable.
Step 3: Testing Your Theory
Core 1 Objective 5.1
As you test your theories, keep in mind rules 8–11.

Symptom or Error Message What to Do About the Problem
System shuts down unexpectedly Try to find out what was happening at the time of the shutdowns to pinpoint
an application or device causing the problem. Possible sources of the problem
are overheating, faulty RAM, the motherboard, or the processor.
System shuts down unexpectedly
and starts back up
Begin by checking the system for overheating. Is the processor cooler fan
working? Go to BIOS/UEFI setup and check the temperature of the processor.
When the processor overheats and the system restarts, the problem is called
a processor thermal trip error.
System locks up with an error
message on a blue screen, called
a blue screen of death (BSOD)
Figure 4-17 shows an example of a BSOD error. These Windows errors are
caused by problems with devices, device drivers, or a corrupted Windows
installation. Begin troubleshooting by searching the Microsoft website for the
error message and a description of the problem.
System locks up with an error
message on a black screen
These error messages on a black background, such as the one shown
in Figure 4-18, are most likely caused by an error at POST. Begin by
troubleshooting the device mentioned in the error message.
System freezes or locks up
without an error message
If the system locks up without an error screen and while still displaying the
Windows Start screen or desktop, the problem is most likely caused by an
application not responding, also called an application crash. Sometimes
you’ll see the Windows pinwheel indicating the system is waiting for a
response from a program or device. Open the Windows Task Manager utility
and end any application that is not responding. If that doesn’t work, restart
Windows.
POST code beeps One or no beep indicates that all is well after POST. However, startup BIOS/
UEFI communicates POST errors as a series of beeps before it tests video.
Search the website of the motherboard or BIOS/UEFI manufacturer to know
how to interpret a series of beep codes. You might need to restart the system
more than once so you can carefully count the beeps. Table 4-5 lists some
common beep codes.
No power If you see no lights on the computer case and hear no spinning fans, make
sure the surge protector or wall outlet has power. Is the switch on the rear
of the case on? Is the dual-voltage selector switch set correctly? Are power
supply connectors securely connected? Is the power supply bad?
Blank screen when you first
power up the computer, and no
noise or indicator lights
Is power getting to the system? If power is getting to the computer, address
the problem as electrical. Make sure the power supply is good and power
supply connectors are securely connected.
Blank screen when you first
power up the computer, and you
can hear the fans spinning and
see indicator lights
Troubleshoot the video subsystem. Is the monitor turned on? Is the monitor
data cable securely connected at both ends? Is the indicator light on the front
of the monitor on?
BIOS/UEFI loses its time and date
settings
“CMOS battery low” error
message appears during the boot
The CMOS battery is failing. Replace the battery.
System reports less memory than
you know is installed
A memory module is not seated correctly or has failed. Begin troubleshooting
memory.
System attempts to boot to the
wrong boot device
Go into BIOS/UEFI setup and change the boot device priority order.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Symptom or Error Message What to Do About the Problem
Fans spin, but no power to other
devices
Begin by checking the power supply. Are connectors securely connected? Use
a power supply tester to check for correct voltage outputs.
Smoke or burning smell Consider this a serious electrical problem. Immediately unplug the computer.
Loud whining noise Most likely the noise is made by the power supply or a failing hard drive.
There might be a short. The power supply might be going bad or is underrated
for the system.
Grinding noise Most likely the noise is made by the ball bearings of a fan. Using compressed
air to clean all the fans might fix the problem, but you might have to replace
a failing fan.
Clicking noise A clicking noise likely indicates the magnetic hard drive is failing. Replace the
drive as soon as possible.
Intermittent device failures Failures that come and go might be caused by overheating or failing RAM,
the motherboard, the processor, or the hard drive. Begin by checking the
processor temperature for overheating. Then check RAM for errors and run
diagnostics on the hard drive.
Distended capacitors Failed capacitors on the motherboard or other circuit board are sometimes
distended and discolored on the top of the capacitor. Replace the motherboard.
Possible error messages:
“No boot device available”
“Hard drive not found”
“Fixed disk error”
“Invalid boot disk”
“Inaccessible boot device or drive”
“Invalid drive specification”
Startup BIOS/UEFI did not find a device to use to load the operating system.
Make sure the boot device priority order is correct in BIOS/UEFI setup.
Try booting from a bootable USB flash drive or DVD. If this works, begin
troubleshooting the hard drive, which is covered in the module “Hard Drives
and Other Storage Devices.”
Possible error messages:
“Missing operating system”
“Error loading operating system”
Windows startup programs are missing or corrupted. How to troubleshoot
Windows startup is covered in the module “Troubleshooting Windows
Startup.”

By the time you have finished Step 3, the problem might already be solved or you will know the source of the
problem and will be ready to plan a solution.
Step 4: Planning Your Solution and then Fixing the Problem
Core 1 Objective 5.1
Some solutions, such as replacing a hard drive or a motherboard, are expensive and time consuming. You need to
carefully consider what you will do and the order in which you will do it. When planning and implementing your
solution, keep rules 12 and 13 in mind.

Do the following to plan your solution and fix the problem:
1. Consider different solutions and select the least invasive one. When appropriate, talk with the user or
owner about the best solution.
2. Before applying your solution, do your best to determine what works and doesn’t work in the system so
you know your starting point.
3. Fix the problem. This might be as simple as switching to a new monitor, or it might be as difficult as
reinstalling Windows and applications software and restoring data from backups.
Hardware and software products generally have technical documentation available. If you don’t find it on hand,
know that you are likely to find user manuals and technical support manuals as .pdf files that can be downloaded
from the product manufacturers’ websites. These sites might offer troubleshooting and support pages, help forums,
chat sessions, email support, and links to submit a troubleshooting ticket to the manufacturer (see Figure 4-19). For
Windows problems, the best websites to search are docs.microsoft.com and support.microsoft.com.
Rule 12: Use the Least Invasive Solution First
As you solve computer problems, always keep in mind that you don’t want to make things worse, so you should use
the least invasive solution. You want to fix the problem in such a way that the system is returned to normal working
condition with the least amount of effort and fewest changes. For example, don’t format the hard drive until you’ve first
tried to fix the problem without having to erase everything on the drive. As another example, don’t reinstall Microsoft
365 until you have tried applying patches to the existing installation.
Rule 13: Know Your Starting Point
Find out what works and doesn’t work before you take anything apart or try a possible fix. Suppose you decide to install
a new anti-malware program. After the installation, you discover Microsoft 365 gives errors and you cannot print to the
network printer. You don’t know if the anti-malware program is causing problems or the problems existed before you
began work. As often as possible, find out what works or what doesn’t work before you attempt a fix.

Step 5: Verifying the Fix and Taking Preventive Action
Core 1 Objective 5.1
After you have fixed the problem, reboot the system and verify that all is well. Can you reach the Internet, use the
printer, or use Excel in Microsoft 365? If possible, have the user check everything and verify that the job is done
satisfactorily. If either of you finds a problem, return to Step 2 in the troubleshooting process to examine the system
and form a new theory as to the cause of the problem.
After you and the user have verified all is working, ask yourself the question, “Could this problem have been
prevented?” If so, go the extra mile to instruct the user, set Windows to automatically install updates, or do whatever
else is appropriate to prevent future problems.
Step 6: Documenting What Happened
Core 1 Objective 5.1
Good documentation helps you take what you learned into the next troubleshooting situation, train others, develop
effective preventive maintenance plans, and satisfy any audits or customer or employer queries about your work.
Most companies use call-tracking software for this purpose. Be sure to include initial symptoms, the source of the
problem, your troubleshooting steps, and what you did to ultimately fix it. Make the notes detailed enough so that
you or someone else can use them later, when solving similar problems.
For on-site support, a customer expects documentation about your services. Include in the documentation sufficient details broken down by cost of individual parts, hours worked, and cost per hour. Give the documentation to the
customer at the end of the service, and keep a copy for yourself. For phone support, the documentation stays in-house.
Now you’re ready to look at how to troubleshoot each subsystem that is critical to booting up the computer.
We begin with the electrical system.

Troubleshooting the Electrical System
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 5.2
Electrical problems can occur before or after the boot and can be consistent or intermittent. Repair technicians often
don’t recognize the cause of a problem to be electrical because of the intermittent nature of some electrical problems.
In these situations, the hard drive, memory, the OS, or even user error might be suspected as the source of the problem
and then systematically eliminated before the electrical system is suspected. This section will help you to be aware
of symptoms of electrical problems so you can zero in on the source of an electrical problem as quickly as possible.
Taking Good Notes
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.1
Darnell had not been a good notetaker in school, and his ineffectiveness in this area was affecting his work. His manager, Jonathan, had been reviewing Darnell’s notes in the ticketing system at the help desk and was not happy with
what he saw. Jonathan had pointed out to Darnell more than once that his cryptic, incomplete notes with sketchy
information would one day cause major problems.
On Monday morning, calls were hammering the help desk because a server had gone down over the weekend, and
many internal customers were not able to get to their data. Darnell escalated one call from a customer named Andre
to a tier-two help desk. Later that day, Asia, a tier-two technician, received the escalated ticket, and to her dismay, the
phone number of the customer was missing. She called Darnell. “How am I to call this customer? You only have his first
name, and these notes about the problem don’t even make sense!” Darnell apologized to Asia, but the damage was done.
Two days later, an angry Andre calls the manager of the help desk to complain that his problem is still not solved.
Jonathan listens to Andre vent and apologizes for the problem his help desk has caused. It’s a little embarrassing
to Jonathan to have to ask Andre for his callback information and to repeat the details of the problem. He gives the
information to Asia, and the problem gets a quick resolution.
Discuss this situation in a small group, and answer the following questions:
1. If you were Darnell, what could you do to improve note-taking in the ticketing system?
2. After Asia called, do you think Darnell should have told Jonathan about the problem? Why or why not?
3. If you were Jonathan, how would you handle the situation with Darnell?
Have two students play the roles of Darnell and Jonathan when Jonathan calls Darnell into his office to discuss
the call he just received from Andre. The other students in the group can watch and make suggestions as to how
to improve the conversation.

Your friend Sharon calls to ask for your help with a computer problem. Her system has been working fine for more
than a year, but now strange things are happening. Sometimes the system powers down for no apparent reason
while she is working, and sometimes Windows locks up. As you read this section, look for clues as to what the problem might be. Also, think of questions to ask your friend that will help you diagnose the problem.

The following are possible symptoms of a problem with the electrical system:
●● The computer appears “dead”—no indicator lights and no spinning drive or fan.
●● The computer sometimes locks up during booting. After several tries, it boots successfully. Error codes or
beeps occur during booting, but they come and go.
●● You smell burnt parts or odors. (Definitely not a good sign!)
●● The computer powers down at unexpected times.
●● The computer appears dead, but you hear a whine coming from the power supply.
The following list contains some questions you can ask and things you can do to solve a problem with the electrical system without opening the computer case. The rule of thumb is “Try the simple things first.” Most computer
problems have simple solutions.
●● If you smell any burnt parts or odors, don’t try to turn the system on. Identify the component that is fried,
and replace it.
●● If you hear a whine coming from the power supply when you first plug up power to a system, the power
supply might be inadequate for the system, or there might be a short. Don’t press the power button to start
up the system. Unplug the power cord so the power supply will not be damaged. The next step is to open
the case and search for a short. If you don’t find a short, consider upgrading the power supply.
●● Is the power cord plugged in? If it is plugged into a power strip or surge suppressor, is the device turned
on and plugged in?
●● Is the power outlet controlled by a wall switch? If so, is the switch turned on?
●● Are any cable connections loose?
●● Is the circuit breaker blown? Is the house circuit overloaded?
●● Are all switches on the system turned on? Computer? Monitor? Surge suppressor or UPS (uninterruptible
power supply)?
●● Is there a possibility the system has overheated? If so, wait a while and try turning on the computer again.
If the system comes on but later turns itself off, you might need additional cooling fans inside the unit. How
to solve problems with overheating is covered later in this module.
●● Older computers might be affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI). Check for sources of electrical or
magnetic interference such as fluorescent lighting or an electric fan or copier sitting near the computer case.
Caution
Before opening the case of a brand-name computer, such as an HP or Dell, consider the warranty. If the system is still
under warranty, sometimes the warranty is voided if the case is opened. If the warranty prevents you from opening
the case, you might need to return the system to a manufacturer’s service center for repairs.
If the problem is still not solved, it’s time to look inside the case. First, turn off the computer, unplug it, press
the power button to drain residual power, and then open the case. Next, do the following:
●● Check all power connections from the power supply to the motherboard and drives. Also, some cases
require the front panel to be in place before the power-on button will work. Are all cards securely seated?
●● If you smell burnt parts, carefully search for shorts and for frayed and burnt wires. Also look for cracked
chips, chips with a burnt hole on top, or fine black dust around a chip. Disassemble the parts until you find
the one that is damaged.
●● If you suspect the power supply is bad, test it with a power supply tester.
Problems That Come and Go
Core 1 Objective 5.2
If a system boots successfully to the Windows Start screen or desktop, you still might have a power system problem.
Some problems are intermittent; that is, they come and go. Generally, intermittent problems are more difficult to

solve than a dead system. There can be many causes of intermittent problems, such as an inadequate power supply, overheating, and devices and components damaged by ESD. Here are some symptoms that might indicate an
intermittent problem with the electrical system after the boot:
●● The computer stops or hangs for no reason. Sometimes it might even reboot itself.
●● Memory errors appear intermittently.
●● Data is written incorrectly to the hard drive or files are corrupted.
●● The keyboard stops working at odd times.
●● The motherboard fails or is damaged.
●● The power supply overheats and becomes hot to the touch.
●● The power supply fan whines and becomes very noisy or stops.
Here is what to do to eliminate the electrical system as the source of an intermittent problem:
1. Consider the power supply may be inadequate. If the power supply is grossly inadequate, it will whine
when you first plug up the power. If you have just installed new devices that are drawing additional
power, verify that the wattage rating of the power supply is adequate for the system.
You can also test the system to make sure you don’t have power problems by making all the devices
in your system work at the same time. For instance, you can make two hard drives and the DVD drive
work at the same time by copying files from one hard drive to the other while playing a movie on the
DVD. If the drives and the other devices each work independently, but data errors occur when all work
at the same time, suspect a shortage of electrical power.
2. Suspect the power supply is faulty. You can test it using either a power supply tester (the easier
method) or a multimeter (the more tedious method). However, know that a power supply that gives
correct voltages when you measure it might still be the source of problems because power problems
can be intermittent. Also be aware that an ATX power supply monitors the range of voltages provided to
the motherboard and halts the motherboard if voltages are inadequate. Therefore, if the power supply
appears “dead,” your best action is to replace it.
3. The power supply fan might not work. Don’t operate the computer if the fan does not work; computers
without cooling fans can quickly overheat. Usually just before a fan stops working, it hums or grinds,
especially when the computer is first turned on. If this has just happened, replace the power supply. If
the new fan does not work after you replace the power supply, you have to dig deeper to find the source
of the problem. You can now assume the problem wasn’t the original fan. A short drawing too much
power somewhere else in the system might cause the problem. To troubleshoot a nonfunctional fan,
which might be a symptom of another problem and not of the fan itself, follow these steps:
a. Turn off the power and remove all power cord connections to all components except the
motherboard. Turn the power back on. If the fan works, the problem is with one of the systems you
disconnected, not with the power supply, the fan, or the motherboard.
b. Turn off the power and reconnect one card or drive at a time until you identify the device with
the short.
c. If the fan does not work when all devices except the motherboard are disconnected, the problem is
the motherboard or the power supply. Because you have already replaced the power supply, you can
assume that the motherboard needs to be replaced.
Power Problems with the Motherboard
Core 1 Objective 5.2
A short might occur if some component on the motherboard makes improper contact with the chassis. This short
can seriously damage the motherboard. For some cases, check for missing standoffs (small plastic or metal spacers that hold the motherboard a short distance away from the bottom of the case). A missing standoff most often
causes these improper connections. Also check for loose standoffs or screws under the board that might be touching a wire on the bottom of the board and causing a short. Shake the case gently, and listen for loose screws or any
other small pieces of a component.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Shorts in the circuits on the motherboard might also cause problems. Look for damage on the bottom of the
motherboard. These circuits are coated with plastic, and quite often damage is difficult to spot. Also look for burnedout capacitors that are spotted brown or corroded. You’ll see examples of burned-out capacitors later in the module.
Caution
Never replace a damaged motherboard with a good one without first testing or replacing the power supply. You don’t
want to subject another good board to possible damage.
Investigating a Computer Problem
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.2
Let’s return to Sharon’s computer problem. Here are some questions that will help you identify the source of the
problem:
●● Have you added new devices to your system? (These new devices might be drawing too much power from
an overworked power supply.)
●● Have you moved your computer recently? (It might be sitting beside a heat vent or electrical equipment.)
Does the system power down or hang after you have been working for some time? (This symptom might
have more than one cause, such as overheating or a power supply, processor, memory, or motherboard
about to fail.)
●● Has the computer case been opened recently? (Someone working inside the case might not have used a
ground bracelet, and components are now failing because of ESD damage.)
●● Are case vents free so air can flow? (The case might be close to a curtain covering the vents.)
Intermittent problems like the one Sharon described are often heat related. If the system only hangs but does
not power off, the problem might be caused by faulty memory or bad software, but because it actually powers down,
you can assume the problem is related to power or heat.
If Sharon tells you that the system powers down after she’s been working for several hours, you can probably
assume overheating. Check that first. If that’s not the problem, the next thing to do is replace the power supply.
Applying Concepts
Problems with Overheating
Core 1 Objective 5.2
As a repair technician, you’re sure to eventually face problems with computers overheating. Overheating can happen
as soon as you turn on the computer or after it has been working a while. Overheating can cause intermittent errors,
the system to hang, or components to fail or not last as long as they normally would. (Overheating can significantly
shorten the life span of the CPU and memory.) Overheating happens for many reasons, including improper installation of the CPU cooler or fans, overclocking, poor airflow inside the case, an underrated power supply, a component
going bad, or the computer’s environment (for example, heat or dust).
Here are some symptoms that a system is overheating:
●● The system hangs or freezes at odd times or freezes just a few moments after the boot starts.
●● A Windows BSOD error occurs during the boot.
●● You cannot hear a fan running, or the fan makes a grinding sound.
●● You cannot feel air being pulled into or out of the case.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
If you suspect overheating, go into BIOS/UEFI setup and
view the temperature monitors for the system. To protect
the expensive processor and other components, you can
also purchase a temperature sensor. The sensor plugs into
a power connection coming from the power supply and
mounts on the side of the case or in a drive bay. The sensor sounds an alarm when the inside of the case becomes
too hot. To decide which temperature sensor to buy, use
one recommended by the case manufacturer. You can also
install utility software that can monitor system temperatures. For example, SpeedFan by Alfredo Comparetti is
freeware that can monitor fan speeds and temperatures
(see Figure 4-20). A good website to download the freeware is filehippo.com/download_speedfan. Be careful not
to download other freeware available on the site.
Here are some simple things you can do to solve an
overheating problem:
1. If the system refuses to boot or hangs after
a period of activity, suspect overheating.
Immediately after the system hangs, go into
BIOS/UEFI setup and find the screen that reports
the CPU temperature. The temperature should
not exceed that recommended by the CPU manufacturer.
2. Excessive dust insulates components and causes components to overheat. Use compressed air, a blower,
or an antistatic vacuum to remove dust from the power supply, the vents over the entire computer, and
the processor cooler fan (see Figure 4-21). To protect the fan, don’t allow it to spin as you blow air into
it. Overspinning might damage a fan.

and system temperatures

When working in a customer’s office or home, be sure you clean up any mess you create from blowing dust out of a
computer case.

3. Check airflow inside the case. Are
all fans running? You might need
to replace a fan. Is there an empty
fan slot on the rear of the case? If
so, install a case fan in the slot (see
Figure 4-22). Orient the fan so it
blows air out of the case. The power
cord to the fan can connect to a fan
header on the motherboard or to a
power connector coming directly
from the power supply.
4. If there are other fan slots on the
side or front of the case, you can also
install fans in these slots. However,
don’t install more fans than the case
is designed to use.
5. A case is generally designed for
optimal airflow when slot openings
on the front and rear of the case are
covered and when the case cover is securely
in place. To improve airflow, replace missing
faceplates over empty drive bays, and replace
missing slot covers over empty expansion slots.
See Figure 4-23.
6. Are cables in the way of airflow? Use cable ties
to secure cables and cords so they don’t block
airflow across the processor or get in the way
of fans turning. Figure 4-24 shows the inside of a
case where cables are tied up and neatly out of
the way of airflow from the front to the rear of
the case.
7. A case needs some room to breathe. Place it
so there are at least a few inches of space on
both sides and the top of the case. If the case is
sitting on carpet, put it on a computer stand so air
can circulate under the case and to reduce carpet
dust inside the case. Many cases have a vent on the
bottom front, and carpet can obstruct airflow into
this vent (see Figure 4-25). Make sure drapes are not
hanging too close to fan openings.
8. Verify that the cooler is connected properly to the
processor. If it doesn’t fit well, the system might
not boot, and the processor will overheat. If the
cooler is not tightly connected to the motherboard
and processor or the cooler fan is not working,
the processor will quickly overheat as soon as the
computer is turned on. Has thermal compound been
installed between the cooler and processor?
9. After you close the case, leave your system off for at
least 30 minutes. When you power up the computer
again, let it run for 10 minutes, go into BIOS/UEFI
setup, check the temperature readings, and reboot.
Figure 4-22 Install one exhaust fan on the rear of the case to
help pull air through the case

expansion slots and bays uncovered

Next, let your system run until it shuts down. Power it up again and check the temperature in BIOS/ UEFI
setup again. A significant difference between this reading and the first one you took after running the
computer for 10 minutes indicates an overheating problem.
10. Check BIOS/UEFI setup to see if the processor is being overclocked. Overclocking can cause a system to
overheat. Try restoring the processor and system bus frequencies to default values.
11. Have too many peripherals been installed inside the case? Is the case too small for all these peripherals?
Larger tower cases are better designed for good airflow than smaller slimline cases. Also, when installing
expansion cards, try to leave an empty slot between each card for better airflow. The same goes for
drives. Try not to install a group of drives in adjacent drive bays. For better airflow, leave empty bays
between drives. Take a close look at Figure 4-24, where you can see space between each drive installed
in the system.
12. Flash BIOS/UEFI to update the firmware on the motherboard. How to flash BIOS/UEFI is covered in the
module “All About Motherboards.”
13. Thermal compound should last for years, but it will eventually harden and need replacing. If the system
is several years old, replace the thermal compound.
Figure 4-25 Keep a tower case off carpet to allow air to flow into
the bottom air vent
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to recognize that a given symptom is possibly power related or heat related.
If you try the preceding list of things to do and still have an overheating problem, it’s time to move on to more
drastic solutions. Consider whether the case design allows for good airflow; the problem might be caused by poor
air circulation inside the case. The power supply fan in ATX cases blows air out of the case, pulling outside air from
the vents in the front of the case across the processor to help keep it cool. Another exhaust fan is usually installed
on the back of the case to help the power supply fan pull air through the case. In addition, most processors require
a cooler with a fan installed on top of the processor. Figure 4-26 shows a good arrangement of vents and fans for
proper airflow and a poor arrangement.
For better ventilation, use a power supply that has vents on the bottom and front, as shown in Figure 4-27. Compare that with the power supply in Figure 4-22, which has vents only on the front and not on the bottom.

An intake fan on the front of the case might help pull air into the case. Intel recommends you use a front intake
fan for high-end systems, but AMD says a front fan for ATX systems is not necessary. Check with the processor and
case manufacturers for specific instructions as to the placement of fans and what type of fan and heat sink to use.
Be careful when trying to solve an overheating problem. Excessive heat can damage the CPU and the motherboard. Never operate a system if the case fan, power-supply fan, or cooler fan is not working.
Problems With Laptop Power Systems
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 5.2
A laptop can be powered by an AC adapter (which uses regular house current to power the laptop) or an installed
battery pack. Battery packs today use lithium ion technology. Most AC adapters today are capable of auto-switching
from 110 V to 220 V AC power. Figure 4-28 shows an AC adapter that has a green light indicating the adapter is
receiving power.

Some mobile users like to keep an extra battery on hand in case the first one uses up its charge. When the laptop signals that power is low, shut down the system, remove the old battery, and replace it with a charged one. To
remove a battery, you usually must release a latch first.
If you’re using the AC adapter to power your laptop when the power goes out, the installed battery serves as a built-in
UPS. The battery immediately takes over as your uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Also, a laptop has an internal
surge protector. However, for extra protection, you might want to use a power strip that provides surge protection.
Note 9
Figure 4-28 This AC adapter for a laptop uses a green light to indicate power
Here are some problems you might encounter with laptop power systems and their solutions:
●● If power is not getting to the system or the battery indicator light is lit when the AC adapter should be supplying power, verify that the AC adapter is plugged into a live electrical outlet. Is the light on the AC adapter
lit? Check if the AC adapter’s plug is secure in the electrical outlet. Check the connections on both sides
of the AC adapter transformer. Check the connection at the DC jack on the laptop. Try exchanging the AC
adapter for one you know is good.
●● If the battery is not charging when the AC adapter is plugged in, the problem might be with the battery or
the motherboard. A hot battery might not charge until it cools down. If the battery is hot, remove it from
the computer, and allow it to cool to room temperature. Check the battery for physical damage. If the battery is swollen or warped, replace it. If it shows no physical signs of damage, try to recharge it. If it does
not recharge, replace the battery pack. If a known good battery does not recharge, you have three options:
(1) Involve the manufacturer for repair under warranty, (2) replace the laptop, or (3) use the laptop only
when it’s connected to power using the AC adapter.
Testing an AC Adapter
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.2
If the system fails only when the AC adapter is connected, it might be defective. Try a new AC adapter, or, if you
have a multimeter, use it to verify the voltage output of the adapter. Do the following for an adapter with a single
centerpin connector:
1. Unplug the AC adapter from the computer, but leave it plugged into the electrical outlet.
2. Most laptops run on 19 V DC, but a few run on 45 V DC. To be on the safe side, set the multimeter to
measure voltage in the range of 1–200 V DC. Place the red probe of the multimeter in the center of the DC
connector that would normally plug into the DC outlet on the laptop. Place the black probe on the outside
cylinder of the DC connector (see Figure 4-29).

Troubleshooting the Motherboard,
Processor, and RAM
Core 1 Objective 5.2
The field replaceable units (FRUs) on a motherboard are the processor, the processor cooler assembly, RAM, and
the CMOS battery. Also, the motherboard itself is an FRU. As you troubleshoot the motherboard and discover that
some component, such as a network port, is not working, you might be able to disable that component in BIOS/UEFI
setup and install a card to take its place.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to troubleshoot problems with motherboards, processors, and RAM.
When you suspect a bad component, a good troubleshooting technique is to substitute a known good component for the one you suspect is bad. Be cautious here. A friend once had a computer that wouldn’t boot. They
replaced the hard drive, with no change. They replaced the motherboard next. The computer booted up with no
problem; they were delighted, until it failed again. Later they discovered that a faulty power supply had damaged

the original motherboard. When they traded the bad one for a good one, the new motherboard also got zapped! If
you suspect problems with the power supply, check the voltage coming from the power supply before putting in a
new motherboard.
The following symptoms can indicate that a motherboard, processor, or memory module is failing:
●● The system begins to boot but then powers down.
●● An error message is displayed during the boot. Investigate this message.
●● The system reports less memory than you know is installed.
●● The system becomes sluggish, unstable, hangs, or freezes at odd times. (This symptom can have multiple
causes, including a failing power supply, RAM, hard drive, motherboard, or processor, Windows errors, and
overheating.)
●● Intermittent Windows or hard drive errors occur.
●● Components on the motherboard or devices connected to it don’t work.
Remember the troubleshooting principle to check the simple things first. The motherboard and processor are
expensive and time consuming to replace. Unless you’re certain the problem is one of these two components, don’t
replace either until you first eliminate other components as the source of the problem.
If you can boot the system, follow these steps to eliminate Windows, software, RAM, BIOS/UEFI settings, and
other software and hardware components as the source of the problem:
1. If an error message appears, google the error message. Pay particular attention to search results about
the motherboard or processor manufacturer or Microsoft websites. Search forums for information about
the error.
2. The problem might be a virus. If you can boot the system, run a current version of antivirus software to
check for viruses.
3. A memory module might be failing. In Windows use the Memory Diagnostic Tool to test memory. Even if
Windows is not installed, you can still run the tool by booting the system from the Windows setup flash
drive or DVD. How to use the Memory Diagnostic Tool is coming up later in this module.
Besides the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool, you can use the Memtest861 utility to test installed memory modules.
Check the site memtest86.com to download this program.
Note 10
4. Suspect the problem is caused by an application or by Windows. In Windows, Device Manager is the best
tool to check for potential hardware problems.
5. In Windows, check Event Viewer logs for a record about a hardware or application problem. You learn to
use Event Viewer in a project at the end of this module.
6. In Windows, download and install any Windows updates or patches. These updates might solve a
hardware or application problem.
7. Ask yourself what has changed since the problem began. If the problem began immediately after
installing a new device or application, uninstall it.
8. A system that does not have enough RAM can sometimes appear to be unstable. Using the Windows
About window, find out how much RAM is installed, and compare that with the recommended amounts.
Consider upgrading RAM.
9. The BIOS/UEFI might be corrupted or have wrong settings. Check BIOS/UEFI setup. Have settings been
tampered with? Is the CPU speed set incorrectly, or is it overclocked? Reset BIOS/UEFI setup to restore
default settings.
10. Disable any quick booting features in BIOS/UEFI so you get a thorough report of POST. Then look for
errors reported on the screen during the boot.
11. Flash BIOS/UEFI to update the firmware on the board.

12. Check the motherboard manufacturer’s website for diagnostic software that might identify a problem
with the motherboard.
13. Update all drivers of motherboard components that are not working. For example, if the USB ports are
not working, try updating the USB drivers with those downloaded from the motherboard manufacturer’s
website. This process can also update the chipset drivers.
14. If an onboard port or device isn’t working, but the motherboard is stable, follow these steps:
a. Verify that the problem is not with the device using the port. Try moving the device to another port
on the same computer or move the device to another computer. If it works there, return it to this
port. The problem might have been a bad connection.
b. Go into BIOS/UEFI setup and verify that the port is enabled.
c. Check Device Manager and verify that Windows recognizes the device or port with no errors. For
example, Device Manager shown in Figure 4-30 reports the onboard Bluetooth device is disabled. Try
to enable the device.
Figure 4-30 Device Manager reports a problem with an onboard device
d. Next try updating the motherboard drivers for this device from the motherboard manufacturer’s website.
e. If you have a loopback plug, use it to test the port.
f. If the problem is still not solved, disable the port in BIOS/UEFI setup and install an expansion card to
provide the same type of port or connector.
15. Suspect the problem is caused by a failing hard drive. How to troubleshoot a failing drive is covered in
the module “Hard Drives and Other Storage Devices.”
16. Suspect the problem is caused by overheating. How to check for overheating is covered earlier in this
module.
17. Verify that the installed processor is supported by the motherboard. Perhaps someone has installed the
wrong processor.

Using the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.2
Errors with memory are often difficult to diagnose because they can appear intermittently and might be mistaken as
sluggish performance, application errors, user errors, or other hardware component errors. Sometimes these errors
cause the system to hang, a blue screen error might occur, or the system continues to function with applications
giving errors or data getting corrupted. You can quickly identify a problem with memory or eliminate memory as the
source of a problem by using the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool. Use one of these two methods to start the utility:
●● Use the mdsched.exe command in Windows. To open a command prompt window from the Windows
desktop, enter the cmd command in the Windows search box. In the command prompt window, enter
mdsched.exe and press Enter. A dialog box appears (see Figure 4-31) and asks if you want to restart
and run the test now or run the test on the next restart.
●● Boot from the Windows setup DVD. If Windows is not the installed operating system or you cannot boot
from the hard drive, boot the computer from the Windows setup USB drive or DVD to test memory for
errors. Follow these steps:
1. If necessary, change the boot priority order in BIOS/UEFI setup to boot first from the optical drive or
USB drive. Boot from the Windows setup DVD or USB drive.
2. On the opening screen for Windows, select your language and click Next. On the next screen (see
Figure 4-32), click Repair your computer. Next choose Troubleshoot. The Advanced options screen
appears.

Using Device Manager to Delete the Driver Store
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.2
One thing you can do to solve a problem with a device is to uninstall and reinstall the device. When you first install a device,
Windows stores a copy of the driver package in a driver store. When you uninstall the device, you can also tell Windows
to delete the driver store. If you don’t delete the driver store, Windows uses it when you install the device again. That’s why
the second time you install the same device, Windows does not ask you for the location of the drivers. Windows might
also use the driver store to automatically install the device on the next reboot without your involvement.
All this is convenient unless there is a problem with the driver store. To get a true fresh start with an installation, you need to delete the driver store. First sign in to Windows using an account with administrative privileges
and then follow these steps:
1. To open Device Manager from the Windows desktop, right-click Start and click Device Manager. Device
Manager opens. Alternately, you can enter devmgmt.msc in the Windows search box or in a command
prompt window.
2. Right-click the device and click Properties in the shortcut menu. Click the Driver tab and click Uninstall
Device. In the Uninstall Device box, check Delete the driver software for this device, and click
Uninstall. See Figure 4-34. The installed drivers and the driver store are both deleted. When you reinstall
the device, you’ll need the drivers on CD or downloaded from the web.

Also know that if the check box is missing in the Uninstall Device dialog box, the drivers are embedded in
Windows, and you cannot delete the driver store for these devices. Examples of these devices are an optical drive,
a hard drive, and a generic keyboard, which all have embedded Windows drivers.
Applying Concepts Continued
We’re working our way through what to do when the system locks up, gives errors, or generally appears unstable.
Another problem that can occur at the boot is continuous reboots, which can be caused by overheating, a failing
processor, motherboard, or RAM, or a corrupted Windows installation.
Windows Startup Repair
Core 1 Objective 5.2
Many continuous restart errors can be solved by performing a Startup Repair process. The Startup Repair utility
restores many of the Windows files needed for a successful boot. After several restarts, Windows will try to automatically run the Startup Repair process. If Startup Repair does not automatically start or does not fix the problem,
try running it from Windows setup media.
Follow these steps to run Startup Repair from the Windows setup USB drive or DVD:
1. If necessary, change the boot priority order in BIOS/UEFI setup to boot first from the USB drive or optical
drive. Boot from the Windows setup USB drive or DVD.
2. On the opening screen, select your language and click Next. On the next screen, click Repair your
computer. Next, choose Troubleshoot. The Advanced options screen appears (refer back to Figure 4-33).
On the Advanced options screen, choose Startup Repair, and select your operating system. Windows
will attempt to repair the system and restart to the Windows desktop.
If you have tried to repair Windows, checked BIOS/UEFI settings, searched the web for help, and still have not
identified the source of the problem, it’s time to open the case and check inside. Be sure to use an ESD strap and
follow other procedures to protect the system against ESD. With the case open, follow these steps:
1. Check that all the system power and data cables are securely connected. Try reseating all expansion
cards and DIMM modules.
2. Look for physical damage on the motherboard. Look for frayed traces on the bottom of the board or
discolored, distended, or bulging capacitors on the board.
3. Reduce the system to essentials. Remove any unnecessary hardware, such as expansion cards, and then
watch to see if the problem goes away. If it does, replace one component at a time until the problem
returns and you have identified the component causing the trouble.
4. Try using a POST diagnostic card. It might offer you a clue as to which component is giving a problem.
5. Suspect the problem is caused by a failing power supply. It’s less expensive and easier to replace than
the motherboard or processor, so eliminate it as a cause before you move on to the motherboard or
processor.
6. Exchange the processor.
7. Exchange the motherboard, but before you do, measure the voltage output of the power supply or
simply replace it, in case it is producing too much power and has damaged the board.

Discolored Capacitors
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.2
Benafsha complained to DeShaun, her IT support technician, that Windows was occasionally giving errors, data
would get corrupted, or an application would not work as it should. At first, DeShaun suspected Benafsha might
need a little more training on how to open and close an application or save a file, but he discovered user error was
not the problem. He tried reinstalling the application software Benafsha most often used and even reinstalled Windows, but the problems persisted.
Applying Concepts
Catastrophic errors (errors that cause the system not to boot or a device not to work) are much easier to resolve
than intermittent errors (errors that come and go).
Note 12
Figure 4-35 These five bad capacitors have bulging and discolored heads
Bad capacitors
DeShaun began to suspect a hardware problem. Carefully examining the motherboard revealed the source of
the problem: failing capacitors. Look carefully at Figure 4-35 and you can see five bad discolored capacitors with
bulging heads. (Know that sometimes a leaking capacitor can also show crusty corrosion at its base.) When DeShaun
replaced the motherboard, the problems went away.

Lessons Learned
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.2
Kiara is putting together a computer from parts for the first time. She has decided to keep costs low and is installing
an AMD processor on a microATX motherboard, using all low-cost parts. She installed the hard drive, optical drive,
and power supply in the computer case. Then she installed the motherboard in the case, followed by the processor, cooler, and memory. Before powering up the system, she checked all connections to make sure they were solid
and read through the motherboard documentation to make sure she did not forget anything important. Next, she
plugs in the monitor to the onboard video port and then plugs in the keyboard and power cord. She takes a deep
breath and turns on the power switch on the back of the computer. Immediately, she hears a faint whine, but she’s
not sure what is making the noise. When she presses the power button on the front of the case, nothing happens.
No fans, no lights. Here are the steps Kiara takes to troubleshoot the problem:
1. She turns off the power switch and unplugs the power cord. She remembers to put on her ground
bracelet and carefully checks all power connections. Everything looks okay.
2. She plugs in the system and presses the power button again. Still all she hears is the faint whine.
3. She presses the power button a second and third time. Suddenly, a loud pop followed by smoke comes
from the power supply, and the strong smell of electronics fills the room! Kiara jumps back in dismay.
4. She removes a known good power supply from another computer, disconnects the blown power supply,
and connects the good one to the computer. When she turns on the power switch, she hears that same
faint whine. She quickly turns off the switch and unplugs the power cord. She does not want to lose
another power supply!
5. Next, Kiara calls technical support of the company that sold her the computer parts. A very helpful
technician listens carefully to the details and tells Kiara that the problem sounds like a short in the
system. He explains that a power supply might whine if too much power is being drawn. As Kiara hangs
up the phone, she begins to think that the problem might be with the motherboard installation.
6. She removes the motherboard from the case, and the source of the problem is evident: She forgot to
install spacers between the board and the case. The board was sitting directly on the bottom of the case,
which had caused the short.
7. Kiara installs the spacers and reinstalls the motherboard. Using the good power supply, she turns on the
system. The whine is gone, but the system is dead.
8. Kiara purchases a new power supply and motherboard and this time carefully uses spacers in every hole
used by the motherboard screws. Figure 4-36 shows one installed spacer and one ready to be installed.
The system comes up without a problem.

In evaluating her experience with her first computer build, Kiara declares the project a success. She was grateful
she had decided to use low-cost parts for her first build. She learned much from the experience and will never, ever
forget to use spacers. She told a friend, “I made a serious mistake, but I learned from it. I feel confident I know how
to put a system together now, and I’m ready to tackle another build.” When you make mistakes and get past them,
your confidence level grows because you learn you can face a serious problem and solve it.
Module Summary
Cooling Methods and Devices
●● Devices that are used to keep a processor and system cool include CPU coolers and fans, thermal compound,
case fans, heat sinks, and liquid cooling systems.
●● Liquid cooling systems use liquids pumped through the system to keep it cool and are sometimes used by
hobbyists when overclocking a system.
Selecting a Power Supply
●● Important features of a power supply to consider before purchase are its form factor, wattage capacity,
number and type of connectors it provides, and warranty.
●● To decide on the wattage capacity of a power supply, add up the wattage requirements for all components
in a system and then increase that total by about 30%. The wattage provided by the 112 V rail is also
important.
Strategies to Troubleshoot Any Computer Problem
●● The six steps in the troubleshooting process are (1) interview the user and back up data, (2) examine the
system and form a theory of probable cause (your best guess), (3) test your theory, (4) plan a solution and
implement it, (5) verify that everything works and take appropriate preventive measures, and (6) document
what you did and the final outcome.
●● If possible, always begin troubleshooting a computer problem by interviewing the user. Find out
when the problem started and what happened about the time it started. You also need to know if
important data on the computer is not backed up. When troubleshooting, set your priorities based on
user needs.
●● Sources that can help with hardware troubleshooting are the web, online technical support and forums,
diagnostic software, user manuals, and your network of technical associates.
●● When troubleshooting, check the simple things first. For example, you can scan for viruses, test RAM, and
run diagnostic software before you begin the process of replacing expensive components.
●● Decide if a computer problem occurs before or after a successful boot and if it is caused by hardware or
software. After you have fixed the problem, verify the fix and document the outcome.
●● When troubleshooting laptops, consider the warranty and that replacing a component might cost more than
replacing the device. If possible, substitute an external component for an internal one.
Troubleshooting the Electrical System
●● To determine if a system is getting power, listen for spinning fans or drives and look for indicator lights.
●● Use a power supply tester to test the power supply.
●● Intermittent problems that come and go are the most difficult to solve and can be caused by hardware
or software. The power supply, motherboard, RAM, processor, hard drive, and overheating can cause
intermittent problems.

●● Removing dust from a system, providing for proper ventilation, and installing extra fans can help keep a
system from overheating.
●● A laptop battery is considered a field replaceable unit (FRU) that pertains to the power system.
●● Use a multimeter to check the voltage output of a laptop AC adapter.
Troubleshooting the Motherboard, Processor, and RAM
●● BIOS/UEFI gives beep codes when a POST error occurs during the boot before it tests video.
●● Error messages on a black screen during the boot are usually put there by startup BIOS/UEFI during
POST.
●● Error messages on a blue screen during or after the boot are put there by Windows and are called the blue
screen of death (BSOD).
●● The motherboard, processor, RAM, processor cooler assembly, and CMOS battery are field replaceable units.
●● An unstable system that freezes or hangs at odd times can be caused by a faulty power supply, RAM, hard
drive, motherboard, or processor, a Windows error, or overheating.
●● A POST diagnostic card can troubleshoot problems with the motherboard.

Sabotaging and Repairing a Computer
Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.1
Open the computer case, and create a hardware problem with your computer that prevents it from booting without damaging a component. For example, you can disconnect a data cable or power cable or loosen a DIMM in a
memory slot. Close the computer case, and restart the system. Describe the problem as if you were a user who
does not know much about computer hardware. Power down the system, and fix the problem. Boot up the system,
and verify that all is well.

Documenting an Intermittent Problem
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.1
Intermittent problems can make troubleshooting challenging. The trick in diagnosing problems that come and go
is to look for patterns or clues as to when the problems occur. If you or the user can’t reproduce the problem at
will, ask the user to keep a log of when the problems occur and exactly what messages appear. Tell the user that
intermittent problems are the hardest to solve and might take some time, but you won’t give up. Show the user how
to take a screenshot of the error messages when they appear. It might also be appropriate to ask the user to email
the screenshot to you. Do the following:
1. Use the Windows Snipping Tool to take a snip of your Windows desktop showing the Explorer window open.
If you need help using the Snipping Tool, see Windows Help and Support, or search the web.
2. Save the snip and email it to your instructor.

Researching IT Support Sites
Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.1
The web is an excellent resource to use when problem-solving, and it’s helpful to know which websites are trustworthy and useful. Access each of the websites listed in Table 4-6, and print one webpage from each site that shows
information that might be useful for a support technician. If the site offers a free email newsletter, consider subscribing to it. Answer the following questions about these sites:
1. Which site can help you find out what type of RAM you can use on your computer?
2. Which site explains Moore’s Law? What is Moore’s Law?
3. Which site has a store with tools to repair computers?

Replacing a Power Supply
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.5
Suppose you turn on a system and everything is dead—no lights, nothing on the monitor screen, and no spinning
fan or hard drive. You verify that the power to the system works, all power connections and power cords are securely
connected, and all pertinent switches are turned on. You can assume the power supply has gone bad. It’s time to
replace it. To prepare for this situation in a real work environment, exchange power supplies with another student
in your lab who is using a computer that has a power supply rated at about the same wattage as yours. Then verify
that your system starts up and works.

Using Event Viewer to Troubleshoot a Hardware Problem
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.1
Just about anything that happens in Windows is recorded in Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc). You can find information
about events such as a hardware or network failure, OS error messages, or a device that has failed to start. When
you first encounter a Windows, hardware, application, or security problem, get in the habit of checking Event Viewer
as one of your first steps toward investigating the problem. To save time, first check the Administrative Events log
because it filters out all events except Warning and Error events, which are the most useful for troubleshooting.
Then start looking in the other logs if you can’t find an event you know happened. Do the following to practice using
Event Viewer:
1. Enter eventvwr.msc in the Windows search box or in a command prompt window. Event Viewer opens.
Drill down into the Custom Views list in the left pane, and click Administrative Events. Scroll through the
list of Error or Warning events, and list any that indicate a possible hardware problem. Make note of the
first event in the list.
2. Disconnect the network cable.
3. In the Event Viewer menu bar, click Action and Refresh to refresh the list of events. How many new events
do you see? Click each new event to see its details below the list of events until you find the event that
tells you the network cable was unplugged. Figure 4-37 shows Event Viewer’s Administrative Events view.
Describe the details of the event about the network cable.
4. Tinker around with other hardware on your computer. What actions did you take that triggered a Warning
or Error event in Event Viewer?

Troubleshooting a Hung System
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.2
A user complains to you that the system hangs for no known reason. After asking them a few questions, you identify
these symptoms:
●● The system hangs after about 15–20 minutes of operation.
●● When the system hangs, it doesn’t matter which application is open or how many applications are open.
●● When the system hangs, it appears as though power is turned off: There are no lights, spinning drives, or
other evidence of power.
You suspect overheating might be the problem. To test your theory, you decide to do the following:
1. You want to verify that the user has not overclocked the system. How do you do that?
2. You decide to check for overheating by examining the temperature of the system immediately after the
system is powered up and then again immediately after the system hangs. Describe the steps you take to
do this.
3. After doing the first two steps, you decide overheating is the cause of the problem. What are four things you
can do to fix the problem?

Introduction
The hard drive is the most important permanent storage device in a computer, and supporting hard drives is one
of the more important tasks of a computer support technician. This module introduces the different kinds of hard
drive technologies and the ways a computer interfaces with a hard drive. You learn how to select and install the
different types of hard drives and how to troubleshoot hard drive problems. You also learn how to select and install
optical drives in desktops. This module also covers solid-state storage, including flash drives and memory cards,
and which type to buy for a particular need.
Hard Drive Technologies and
Interface Standards
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 3.1, 3.3
A hard disk drive (HDD), most often called a hard
drive, is rated by its physical size, capacity, speed,
technologies used inside the drive, and interface standards. First, we look at the features of a hard drive,
and then we turn to how the drive interfaces with the
computer.
Technologies and Form Factors of Hard Drives
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 3.1, 3.3
The two types of hardware technologies used inside the drive are magnetic and solid-state. Each hard drive technology uses several form factors, all discussed in this section of the module.
Magnetic Hard Drives
A magnetic hard drive has one, two, or more platters, or disks, that stack together and spin in unison inside a sealed
metal housing that contains firmware to control reading and writing data to the drive and to communicate with the
motherboard. The top and bottom of each disk have a read/write head that moves across the disk surface as all
the disks rotate on a spindle (see Figure 5-1). All the read/write heads are controlled by an actuator, which moves
the read/write heads across the disk surfaces in unison. The disk surfaces are covered with a magnetic medium that
can hold data as magnetized spots. The spindle rotates at 5400, 7200, 10,000, or 15,000 RPM (revolutions per minute).
The faster the spindle, the better the drive performs. Most consumer hard drives are rated at 5400 or 7200 RPM.
In technical documentation, you might see a hard drive
abbreviated as HDD (hard disk drive). However, this module uses the term “hard drive”.

Note 2
Data is organized on a magnetic hard drive in concentric circles called tracks (see Figure 5-2). Each track is
divided into segments called sectors (also called records). Older hard drives used sectors that contained 512 bytes.
Most current hard drives use 4096-byte sectors.

Solid-State Drives
A solid-state drive (SSD), also called a solid-state device, is so named because it has no moving parts. The drives
are built using nonvolatile memory, which is similar to that used for USB flash drives and memory cards. Recall that
this type of memory does not lose its data even after the power is turned off.
In an SSD, flash memory is stored on chips on a circuit board inside the drive housing (see Figure 5-5). The
chips contain grids of rows and columns with two transistors at each intersection that hold a 0 or 1 bit. One of these
transistors is called a floating gate and accepts the 0 or 1 state according to a logic test called NAND (stands for “Not
AND”). Therefore, the memory in an SSD is called NAND flash memory.
Transistors are limited to the number of times
they can be reprogrammed. Therefore, the life span
of an SSD is based on the number of write operations
to the drive, and it can be expressed as TBW (terabytes written) or DWPD (drive writes per day) over
its expected life. (The number of read operations does
not affect the life span.) For example, one SSD manufacturer guarantees its SSDs for 70 TBW, which means
70 TB or 70,000 GB write operations for the duration of
the drive. Another manufacturer might rate the drive
as DWPD—for example, 70 GB write operations per
day for five years. For normal use, a drive would not
be used that much and would last much longer. However, the drive warranty is only for five years.
Because flash memory is expensive, solid-state
drives are much more expensive than magnetic hard drives of the same capacity, but they are faster and more reliable, last longer, and use less power than magnetic drives.
You need to be aware of four popular form factors used by SSDs:
●● 2.5" SSD. The 2.5" SSD (see the left side of Figure 5-6) is used in desktops and laptops and can mount in the same
bays and use the same cable connectors as those used by 2.5" magnetic drives.
●● M.2 SSD card. The M.2 SSD form factor (see the right side of Figure 5-6) is a small M.2 card that uses the
motherboard M.2 slot you learned about in the module “All About Motherboards.”

M.2 SSDs
●● mSATA SSD. The mSATA, or miniSATA, uses
SATA Revision 3.x and is a smaller, thinner version of a full-sized SATA SSD without a casing
(see Figure 5-7). The mSATA and mini PCIe slots
share the same form factor, but not all hosts or
motherboards support both in the same slot.
Always refer to your motherboard documentation to find out if the slot will support an
mSATA SSD.
●● PCI Express SSD expansion card. An SSD can
be embedded on a PCIe expansion card (see
Figure 5-8). These drives generally have a faster
interface with the CPU than 2.5" SSDs and may
also be faster than an M.2 SSD, depending on
how the M.2 slot interfaces with the CPU. A PCIe
SSD uses the NVMe interface discussed later in
the module.
Hard Drive Performance
There are three primary measurements for
hard drive performance in both magnetic
hard drives and SSDs. You can use these
measurements to decide which hard drive
best meets the needs of the computer or
to diagnose a problem with the hard drive
performance. The measurements are as
follows:
●● Throughput is typically measured
in MB/sec, and it describes the
amount of data that flows through
a point in the data path over one
second’s time. A higher throughput means better performance.
This measurement is important for
streaming large files, such as videos.
●● IOPS (input/output operations per second) measures the amount of read or write operations performed
in one second. A higher IOPS means better performance.
●● Latency measures the time required to process a data request or transaction. A lower latency time means
better performance.

S.M.A.R.T.
You need to be aware of one more technology supported by both SSD and magnetic hard drives: S.M.A.R.T. (selfmonitoring, analysis, and reporting technology), which is used to predict when a drive is likely to fail. System BIOS/
UEFI uses S.M.A.R.T. to monitor drive performance, temperature, and other factors. For magnetic drives, it monitors
disk spin-up time, distance between the head and the disk, and other mechanical activities of the drive. Many SSDs
report to the BIOS/UEFI the number of write operations, which is the best measurement of when the drive might
fail. If S.M.A.R.T. suspects a drive failure is about to
happen, it displays a warning message. S.M.A.R.T. can
be enabled and disabled in BIOS/ UEFI setup.
Now let’s look at how the drive’s firmware or
controller communicates with the motherboard and
processor.
Interface Standards Used by Hard Drives
Core 1 Objectives 3.1, 3.3
Four interface standards used by hard drives include IDE (outdated), SCSI (also outdated), SATA (the most popular
current standard), and NVMe (the latest and fastest standard.)
Many solid-state drive manufacturers reserve blocks on the drive that are used when other blocks begin to prove they
are no longer reliable. Also, a technique called wear leveling assures that the logical block addressing does not always
address the same physical blocks in order to distribute write operations more evenly across the device.
Note 3
Malware has been known to give false S.M.A.R.T. alerts.
Note 4
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to recognize the cables and connectors for the IDE, SCSI, SATA, eSATA, and NVMe
interfaces. Given a scenario, you may be expected to decide which interface to use (PCIe, SATA, or NVMe) and be able
to install and configure devices that use these interfaces.
IDE
Years ago, hard drives used the Parallel ATA (PATA) standards, also called the IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics)
standards, to connect to a motherboard. PATA allowed for one or two IDE connectors on a motherboard, each using
a 40-pin data cable. Two drives could connect to one cable (see Figure 5-9).
Two types of IDE cables are the older cable with a 40-pin connector and 40 wires and a newer cable with the
same 40-pin connector and 80 thinner wires (see Figure 5-10). The additional 40 wires reduce crosstalk (interference
that can lead to corrupted communication) on the cable. The later IDE standards required the 80-wire cable. The
maximum recommended length of an IDE cable is 18". The IDE standard is seldom used today.
Logical Block Addressing and Capacity
Before a magnetic drive leaves the factory, sector markings are written to it in a process called low-level formatting.
(This formatting is different from the high-level formatting that Windows does after a drive is installed in a computer.)
The hard drive firmware, BIOS/UEFI on the motherboard, and the OS use a simple sequential numbering system
called logical block addressing (LBA) to address all the sectors on the drive. SSDs are marked into blocks, which
are communicated to the motherboard and OS; they read/write to the drive in blocks, just as with magnetic drives.
SSDs are also low-level formatted before they leave the factory.
The size of each block and the total number of blocks on the drive determine the drive capacity. Today’s drive
capacities are usually measured in GB (gigabytes) or TB (terabytes, each of which is 1024 gigabytes). Magnetic drives
are generally much larger in capacity at a lower cost than SSDs.

SCSI
In the distant past, a few personal computer hard drives designed for high-end workstations used the SCSI (Small
Computer System Interface) standard. SCSI (pronounced “scuzzy”) can support up to seven or 15 SCSI-compliant
devices in a system. Most often, a SCSI expansion card (see Figure 5-11), called the SCSI host adapter, used a PCIe slot
and provided one external connector for an external SCSI device, such as a SCSI printer, and one internal connector

for internal SCSI devices, such as hard drives and optical
drives. Figure 5-12 shows a long SCSI cable. One end of the
cable connects to the host adapter, and the other connectors are used for external SCSI devices. SCSI evolved over
the years with various connector types and cables. It is
now sometimes found on servers but is no longer used in
personal computers.
SATA
Most hard drives in today’s personal computers use the
SATA interface standards to connect to the motherboard.
The serial ATA or SATA (pronounced “say-ta”) standard
uses a serial data path, and a SATA data cable can accommodate a single SATA drive (see Figure 5-13). The three
SATA standards are as follows:
●● SATA Revision 3.x, rated at 6 Gb/sec, is sometimes
called SATA 6 Gb/s.
●● SATA Revision 2.x, rated at 3 Gb/sec, is sometimes
called SATA 3 Gb/s.
●● SATA Revision 1.x, rated at 1.5 Gb/sec, is seldom
seen today.
Interface standards for drives define data speeds and transfer methods between the drive controller, the BIOS/UEFI,
the chipset on the motherboard, and the OS. The standards also define the type of cables and connectors used by the
drive and the motherboard or expansion cards. SATA cables work for all three SATA standards.

The SATA 3.2 revision allows for PCIe
and SATA to work together in a technology called SATA Express, which uses a
new SATA connector. The speed of SATA
Express is about three times that of SATA
3.0. However, because SATA Express is not
as fast as NVMe, hard drive manufacturers
have been slow to invest in SATA Express
drives, and only a few motherboards have
SATA Express slots. Figure 5-16 shows a

SATA interfaces are used by all types of drives, including hard drives, CD, DVD, and Blu-ray. SATA supports hotswapping, also called hot-plugging. With hot-swapping, you can connect and disconnect a drive while the system
is running. Hard drives that can be hot-swapped cost significantly more than regular hard drives and are generally
used in servers or other network storage devices.
A SATA drive connects to one internal SATA connector on the motherboard by way of a 7-pin SATA data cable and
uses a 15-pin SATA power connector (see Figure 5-14). An internal SATA data cable can be up to 1 meter in length.
A motherboard might have two or more SATA connectors; use the connectors in the order recommended in the
motherboard user guide. For example, for the four connectors shown in Figure 5-15, the motherboard user guide
recommends using the red ones before the black ones.

board with seven SATA ports. When the one SATA Express port is used, the two normal SATA ports grouped with it
are disabled.
In addition to internal SATA connectors, the
motherboard or an expansion card can provide
external SATA (eSATA) ports for external drives
(see Figure 5-17). External SATA drives use a special
external shielded SATA cable up to 2 meters long.
Seven-pin eSATA ports run at the same speed as
the internal ports using SATA Revision 1.x, 2.x, or
3.x standards. The eSATA port is shaped differently
from an internal SATA connector to prevent people
from using the unshielded internal SATA data cables
with the eSATA port.
Figure 5-17 Two eSATA ports on a motherboard
When purchasing a SATA hard drive, keep in mind that the SATA standards for the drive and the motherboard
need to match. If either the drive or the motherboard uses a slower SATA standard than the other device, the system
will run at the slower speed.
NVMe
Whereas the SATA interface is used by both magnetic and solid-state drives, the newer NVMe (Non-Volatile
Memory Express or NVM Express) interface standard is used only by SSDs. Magnetic hard drives are slow
enough that a SATA interface is adequate, but SSDs are so fast that the SATA interface becomes a performance
bottleneck. NVMe uses the faster PCI Express ×4 interface to communicate with the processor. Here are the
comparisons:
●● The most common SATA standard, SATA Revision 3.x, transfers data at 6 Gb/sec.
●● NVMe uses one of two common PCIe standards, PCIe 4.0 or PCIe 3.0, which transfers data at 2 GB/sec
per lane and 1 GB/sec per lane, respectively. Converted from gigabyte to gigabit, PCIe 3.0 transfers data
at 8 Gb/sec per lane. NVMe uses four lanes (PCIe ×4), yielding a transfer rate of 8 Gb/sec x 4 5 32 Gb/sec.
Therefore, the NVMe transfer rate of 32 Gb/sec is more than five times faster than SATA Revision 3.x’s
transfer rate of 6 Gb/sec. PCIe 4.0 is twice as fast as PCIe 3.0.
The PCIe NVMe interface might be used in three ways:
●● PCIe expansion card. The NVMe interface is used by SSDs embedded on PCIe expansion cards. Refer back
to Figure 5-8.
●● U.2 or U.3 slot. A 2.5" SSD can support the NVMe interface using a U.2 or U.3 connector on the drive and
a U.2 or U.3 port on the motherboard. A U.3 drive is compatible with a U.2 or U.3 port on a motherboard,
but a U.2 drive is only compatible with a U.2 port on a motherboard. See Figure 5-18. These drives might be
advertised as a PCIe drive, U.2/U.3 drive, or NVMe solid-state drive.
External hard drives can connect to a computer
by way of external SATA (eSATA) or USB. Be sure
the port provided by the computer uses the
same standard that the external drive uses—for
­example, SuperSpeed USB 3.0 or eSATA ­Revision 3.
If the port is not fast enough, you can install an
expansion card to provide faster ports.

●● M.2 port. An M.2 SSD card might use
the NVMe or SATA standard. Recall
that an M.2 slot on a motherboard
might interface with the processor
using the USB, SATA, or PCIe bus. If
the slot uses the PCIe bus and the
M.2 SSD card uses the NVMe interface, the 32 Gb/sec transfer rate can
be attained. If your motherboard
does not have an M.2 port, you can
use a PCIe adapter card (also called a
carrier card) to provide M.2 ports for
M.2 SSDs (see Figure 5-19).
Most motherboards today have PCIe
expansion slots, and M.2 slots are more
common on motherboards than U.2 ports.
For M.2 slots, check the motherboard
documentation to find out which bus the
M.2 slot uses and whether you can boot
the system from the SSD card installed
in the slot. Some motherboards, such
as the ASUS Prime Z370P, provide two
M.2 slots, which can be configured in a
RAID array. For this board, you can purchase the ASUS Hyper M.2 ×16 card (see
Figure 5-20) to install in the first PCIe ×16
slot and install up to four M.2 SSDs on the
card. These four drives can be configured
in a RAID array, and you can use BIOS/
UEFI to enable the card so you can boot
the system from this RAID array of SSDs.
You learn more about RAID later in
this module.
Now that you know about the various hard drive technologies and interfaces, let’s see how to select and install
a hard drive.

How to Select and Install Hard Drives
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 3.1, 3.3
In this section of the module, you learn how to select a hard drive for your system. Then you learn the details of
installing a SATA drive. Next, you learn how to deal with using removable bays, the problem of installing a hard drive
in a bay that is too wide for it, and special considerations for installing a hard drive in a laptop. You also learn how
to set up a RAID system.
Selecting a Hard Drive
Core 1 Objective 3.3
When selecting a hard drive, keep in mind that to get the best performance from the system, the motherboard and
drive must support the same interface standard. If they don’t support the same standard, they revert to the slower
standard that both can use, or the drive will not work at all. There’s no point in buying an expensive hard drive with
features that your system cannot support.
Therefore, when making purchasing decisions, you need to know the standards for the motherboard slot or port
and perhaps for the expansion card that might provide the drive interface. Find out by reading the motherboard
manual. Here are some options for compatibility:
●● SATA ports on a motherboard are usually color-coded to indicate which SATA standard the port supports.
A motherboard typically has a mix of SATA Revision 3.x and SATA Revision 2.x ports. A SATA drive is rated
for one SATA standard but can run at the slower speed of the SATA port.
●● M.2 slots might support PCIe 4.0, PCIe 3.0, PCIe 2.0, SATA Revision 2.x, SATA Revision 3.x, or USB 3.0. M.2
ports might be keyed to one notch or two and can accommodate up to three sizes of cards. Match the card
to the slot and its fastest standard.
●● When an M.2 port with a card installed is using the SATA bus, one of the SATA ports might be disabled. Be
sure to know which one so you don’t attempt to use it for another device.
●● NVMe expansion cards most likely use a PCIe ×4 version 3.0 or newer slot. A motherboard might have multiple PCIe ×4 slots. Use one that supports the latest version of PCIe.
Besides compatibility, consider the features already discussed in this module when purchasing a hard drive:
●● Technology (SSD is faster and lasts longer than a magnetic drive)
●● Form factor (3.5" or 2.5" for magnetic drives or 2.5", M.2, U.2/U.3, or PCIe card for SSDs)
●● Capacity (in GB or TB)
●● Data transfer rate as determined by the drive interface (SATA 6.0 Gb/s, SATA 3.0 Gb/s, PCIe ×4 32 Gb/s, and
so forth)
●● For magnetic drives, the spindle speed (5400, 7200, 10,000, or 15,000 RPM), which affects performance
Some hard drive manufacturers are listed in Table 5-1. Most manufacturers of memory also make solid-state
drives.

Now let’s turn our attention to the step-by-step process of installing a SATA drive.
Steps to Install a Sata Drive
Core 1 Objective 3.3
In Figure 5-21, you can see the back of a SATA hard drive. A SATA drive might have jumpers used to set features such
as the ability to power up from standby mode. Most likely, if jumpers are present on a SATA drive, the factory has
set them as they should be and advises you not to change them.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to configure SATA devices in a system. What you learn in this module
about installing a SATA hard drive in a system also applies to installing a SATA optical drive. Hard drives and optical
drives use a SATA data connector and a power connector.
Some SATA drives have two power connectors, as does the one in Figure 5-22. Choose between the SATA power
connector (which is preferred) and the legacy 4-pin Molex connector, but never install two power cords to the drive
at the same time because it could damage the drive.

Step 1: As Best You Can, Protect the User’s Data
Recall from the module “Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer Problems” that before you work on solving any computer problem, you need to establish your priorities. Your first priority might be the user’s data. If the
user tells you there is important data on the current hard drive and you can boot from it, back up the data to other
media and verify that you can access the data on that media. If the current hard drive will not boot, recall you can
move it to another computer and transfer data to other media. Make every effort possible to protect the user’s data
before you move on to the next step.
Step 2: Know Your Starting Point
As with replacing or installing any other devices, make sure you know your starting point before you begin installing
a hard drive. Answer these questions: How is your system configured? Is everything working properly? Verify which
of your system’s devices are working before installing a new one. Later, if a device does not work, the information will
help you isolate the problem. Keeping notes is a good idea whenever you install new hardware or software or make any
other changes to your computer system. Write down what you know about the system that might be important later.
When installing hardware and software, don’t install too many things at once. If something goes wrong, you won’t know
what’s causing the problem. Install one device, start the system, and confirm that the new device is working before
installing another.
Note 7
Step 3: Read the Documentation and Prepare Your Work Area
Before you take anything apart, carefully read all the documentation for the drive and controller card, as well as
the part of your motherboard documentation that covers hard drive installation. Make sure you can visualize all
the steps in the installation. If you have any questions, keep researching until you locate the answer. You can do a
Google search, have a chat session with technical support, or ask a knowledgeable friend for help. As you get your
questions answered, you might discover that what you are installing will not work on your computer, but that is
better than coping with hours of frustration and a disabled computer. You cannot always anticipate every problem,
but at least you can know that you made your best effort to understand everything in advance. What you learn with
thorough preparation pays off every time!
You’re now ready to set out your tools, documentation, new hardware, and notebook. Remember the basic
rules concerning static electricity. Be sure to protect against electrostatic discharge (ESD) by wearing an ESD strap
during the installation. You also should avoid working on carpet in the winter when there’s a lot of static electricity.
Some added precautions for working with a hard drive are as follows:
●● Handle the drive carefully.
●● Do not touch any exposed circuitry or chips.
●● Prevent other people from touching exposed microchips on the drive.
●● When you first take the drive out of the static-protective package, touch the package containing the drive
to a screw holding an expansion card or cover, or to a metal part of the computer case, for at least two
seconds. This drains the static electricity from the package and from your body.
●● If you must set down the drive outside the static-protective package, place it component-side-up on a flat surface.
●● Do not place the drive on the computer case cover or on a metal table.
If you’re assembling a new system, it’s usually best to install drives before you install the motherboard so you
do not accidentally bump sensitive motherboard components with the drives.
Step 4: Install the Drive
Now you’re ready to get started. Follow these steps to install the drive in the case:
1. Shut down the computer, unplug it, and press the power button to drain residual power. Remove the
computer case cover. Check that you have an available power cord from the power supply for the drive.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
2. For 2.5" or 3.5" drives, decide which bay will hold the drive by examining the locations of the drive
bays and the length of the data cables and power cords. Bays designed for hard drives do not have
access to the outside of the case, unlike bays for optical drives. Also, some bays are wider than
others to accommodate wide drives such as a DVD drive. Will the data cable reach the drives and
the motherboard connector? If not, rearrange your plan for locating the drive in a bay, or purchase
a custom-length data cable. Some bays are stationary, meaning the drive is installed inside the bay
because it stays in the case. Other bays are removable; you remove the bay, install the drive in it, and
then return the bay to the case.
3. For a stationary bay, slide the drive in the bay, and then use a screwdriver to secure one side of the
drive with one or two short screws (see Figure 5-23). It’s best to use two screws so the drive will not
move in the bay, but sometimes a bay only provides a place for a single screw on each side. Some drive
bays provide one or two tabs that you pull out before you slide the drive in the bay and then push in to
secure the drive. Another option is a sliding tab (see Figure 5-24) that is used to secure the drive. Pull
the tab back, slide in the drive, and push the tab forward to secure the drive.
If there are not enough power cords from a power supply, you can purchase a Y connector that can add another
power cord.

Do not allow torque to stress the drive. In other words, don’t force a drive into a space that is too small for it. Also
keep in mind that placing two screws in diagonal positions across the drive can place pressure diagonally on the drive.
Note 9
Caution
Be sure the screws are not too long. If they are, you can screw too far into the drive housing, which will damage the
drive itself.
4. When using screws to secure the drive, carefully turn the case over without disturbing the drive, and put
one or two screws on the other side of the drive (see Figure 5-25). To best secure the drive in the case,
use two screws on each side of the drive.

6. Connect a 15-pin SATA power connector or 4-pin Molex power connector from the power supply to the
drive (see Figure 5-28).
5. Check the motherboard documentation to find out which SATA connectors on the board to use first.
For example, five SATA connectors are shown in Figure 5-26. The documentation says the two blue SATA
connectors support 6.0 Gb/sec and slower speeds, and the two black and one red SATA connectors
support 3.0 Gb/sec and slower speeds. On this board, be sure to connect your fastest hard drive to a
blue connector. For some boards, the hard drive that has the bootable OS installed must be connected
to the first SATA connector, which is usually labeled SATA 0. For both the drive and the motherboard,
you can only plug the cable into the connector in one direction. A SATA cable might provide a clip on the
connector to secure it (see Figure 5-27).

Installing a Drive in a Removable Bay
Core 1 Objective 3.3
Now let’s see how a drive installation goes when you are dealing with a removable bay. Figure 5-30 shows a computer
case with a removable bay that has a fan at the front of the bay to help keep the drives cool. (The case manufacturer
calls the bay a fan cage.) The bay is anchored to the case with three black locking pins. The third locking pin from
the bottom of the case is disconnected in the photo.

Unplug the cage fan from its power source. Turn the handle on each locking pin counterclockwise to remove
it. Then slide the bay to the front and out of the case. Insert the hard drive in the bay, and use two screws on each
side to anchor the drive in the bay (see Figure 5-31). Slide the bay back into the case, and reinstall the locking pins.
Plug in the cage fan power cord.

Installing a Small Drive in a Wide Bay
Core 1 Objective 3.3
Because 2.5" drives are smaller than the bays designed for 3.5" drives, you’ll need a universal bay kit to fit these
drives into most desktop computer cases. These inexpensive kits should create a tailor-made fit. In Figure 5-32, you
can see how the universal bay kit adapter works. The adapter spans the distance between the sides of the drive and
the bay. Figure 5-33 shows a SATA SSD with the brackets connected.

that if the M.2 slot is used and the SSD card uses the SATA interface standard, it might disable a SATA Express or
SATA connector on the board. Do the following to install the card:
1. Measure the length of the card, and decide which screw hole for the M.2 slot the card requires. Install a
standoff in the hole.
2. Slide the card straight into the slot but not from an upward angle because you might bend open
the slot and prevent a good connection. Make sure the card is installed securely in the slot. In
Figure 5-34, you can see the card has two notches and can be used in either a B-key M.2 slot (the key
on the left of the slot) or an M-key M.2 slot (the key on the right of the slot). This motherboard has
an M-key slot. Also notice in the figure that the standoff is installed, ready to secure the card to the
board.
Figure 5-34 Slide an SSD card straight into an M.2 slot

3. Install the one screw in the standoff to secure the card to the motherboard. Don’t overtighten the screw
because you might damage the card.
4. Start the system, go into BIOS/UEFI setup, and make sure the M.2 card is recognized by the system. If it
will be the boot device, make the appropriate changes in BIOS/UEFI.
Installing a Hard Drive in a Laptop
Core 1 Objective 1.1
When purchasing and installing an internal hard drive or optical drive in a laptop, see the laptop manufacturer’s
documentation about specific capacities, form factors, and connectors that will fit the laptop. Before deciding to
replace a hard drive, consider these issues:
●● Be aware of voiding a warranty if you don’t follow the laptop manufacturer’s directions.
●● If the old drive has crashed, you’ll need the recovery media to reinstall Windows and the drivers. Make sure
you have the recovery media before you start.
●● If you are upgrading from a lower-capacity drive to a higher-capacity drive, you need to consider
how you will transfer data from the old drive to the new one. One way is to use a USB-to-SATA converter.
Using this converter, both drives can be up and working on the laptop at the same time, so you can
copy files.

Remove the plastic cover, revealing the drive. Lift
and remove the hard drive from the case and bay, and
insert the new drive (see Figure 5-36). Next, replace the
cover and the screw, then power up the system.
When the system boots up, BIOS/UEFI should recognize the new drive and search for an operating system. If
the drive is new, boot from the Windows setup or recovery DVD or USB flash drive, and install the OS.
Here is what you need to know when shopping for
a laptop hard drive:
●● Purchase a hard drive recommended by the laptop
manufacturer. The drive might be magnetic or SSD,
and you’ll need a 2.5" drive. Some high-end laptops
use an M.2 SSD.
●● For a 2.5" drive, expect it to use the SATA interface. SATA data and power connectors on a laptop hard drive look the same as those in a desktop
installation.
Older laptop computers required that you disassemble the laptop to replace a hard drive. With newer
laptops, you should be able to easily replace a drive. For
the laptop shown in Figure 5-35, first power down the
system; remove peripherals, including the AC adapter;
and remove the battery pack. On the bottom of the laptop, remove a screw that holds the drive cover in place
(see Figure 5-35).

It is possible to give general directions on desktop computer repair that apply to all kinds of brands, models, and
systems. Not so with laptops. Learning to repair laptops involves learning unique ways to assemble, disassemble, and
repair components for specific brands and models of laptops.
Note 11
Setting Up Hardware RAID
Core 1 Objective 3.3
For most personal computers, a single hard drive works independently of any other installed drives. A technology
that configures two or more hard drives to work together as an array of drives is called RAID (redundant array of
inexpensive disks or redundant array of independent disks). Here are two reasons you might consider using RAID:
●● To improve performance by writing data to two or more hard drives so that a single drive is not excessively
used.
232

●● RAID 0 also uses two or more physical disks to increase the disk space available for a single volume. RAID 0
writes to the physical disks evenly across both disks so that neither receives all the activity; this improves
performance. Windows calls RAID 0 a striped volume. To understand that term, think of data striped—or
written—across several hard drives. RAID 0 is preferred to spanning.
●● RAID 1 is a type of mirroring that duplicates data on one drive to another drive and is used for fault
tolerance. Each drive has its own volume, and the two volumes are called mirrors. If one drive fails, the
other continues to operate, and data is not lost. Hot-swapping is allowed in RAID 1. Windows calls RAID 1
a mirrored volume.

A Windows volume is a logical hard drive that is assigned a drive letter like C: or E:. The volume can be part or all of a
physical hard drive or can span multiple physical hard drives. Earlier in the module, you learned about the ASUS Prime
Z370-P motherboard, which has two M.2 slots. When you install matching M.2 SSD cards in these slots, you can use
BIOS/UEFI setup to configure these two cards in a RAID 0 array, which creates a superfast single logical hard drive or
Windows volume.
Note 12
●● To improve fault tolerance, which is a computer’s ability to respond to a fault or catastrophe, such as a
hardware failure or power outage, so data is not lost. If data is important enough to justify the cost, you
can protect the data by continuously writing two copies of it, each to a different hard drive. This method
is most often used on high-end, expensive file servers, but it is occasionally appropriate for a single-user
workstation.
Types of RAID
Several types of RAID exist; the four most commonly used are RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 10. The following is
a brief description of each, including another method of two disks working together called spanning. Four methods
are diagrammed in Figure 5-37.
●● Spanning, sometimes called JBOD (just a bunch of disks), uses two hard drives to hold a single Windows
volume, such as drive E:. Data is written to the first drive, and when it is full, the data continues to be written
to the second. The purpose of spanning is to increase the disk space available for a single volume.

All RAID configurations can be accomplished at the hardware level (called hardware RAID) or at the operating
system level (called software RAID). In Windows, you can use the Disk Management utility to group hard drives in
a RAID array. Windows also offers the Storage Spaces utility to implement software RAID. However, software RAID
is considered an unstable solution and is not recommended by Microsoft. Configuring RAID at the hardware level is
considered best practice because if Windows gets corrupted, the hardware might still be able to protect the data.
Also, hardware RAID is generally faster than software RAID.
How to Implement Hardware RAID
Hardware RAID can be set up by using a RAID-enabled motherboard that is managed in BIOS/UEFI setup or by using
a RAID controller card. When using a RAID controller card, run the software that comes with the card to set up your
RAID array.
For best performance in any RAID system, all hard drives in an array should be identical in brand, size, speed,
and other features. If you use different hard drives, the RAID system treats all hard drives the same as the slowest
and smallest hard drive. Also, if Windows will be installed on a hard drive that is part of a RAID array, RAID must
be implemented before Windows is installed because all data on the drives will be lost when you configure RAID.
As with installing any hardware, first read the documentation that comes with the motherboard or RAID controller
and follow those specific directions rather than the general guidelines given here. Make sure you understand which
RAID configurations the board or card supports.
●● RAID 5 stripes data and parity information
across three or more drives and uses parity
checking, so if one drive fails, the other drives
can recreate the data stored on the failed
drive by using the parity information. Data is
not duplicated; therefore, RAID 5 makes better
use of volume capacity. RAID 5 drives increase
performance and provide fault tolerance. Hotswapping is allowed in RAID 5. Windows calls
these drives RAID 5 volumes.
●● RAID 10, also called RAID 110 and pronounced “RAID one zero” (not “RAID ten”), is
a combination of RAID 1 and RAID 0. It takes
at least four disks for RAID 10. Data is mirrored across pairs of disks, as shown at the
top of Figure 5-38. In addition, the two pairs
of disks are striped, as shown at the bottom
of Figure 5-38. To help you better understand
RAID 10, notice the data labeled as A, A, B,
B across the first stripe. RAID 10 is the most
expensive solution that provides the best
redundancy and performance and allows for
hot-swapping.

Three hard
drives
Figure 5-40 Configure SATA ports on the motherboard to enable RAID
For one motherboard that has six SATA connectors that support RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10, here are the general directions to install three hard drives in a RAID 5 array:
1. Install the three SATA drives in the
computer case, and connect each
drive to a SATA connector on the
motherboard (see Figure 5-39). To
help keep the drives cool, install
them with an empty bay between
each drive.
2. Boot the system and enter BIOS/
UEFI setup. On the Advanced setup
screen, verify that the three drives
are recognized. Select the option
to configure SATA Mode Selection,
and then select RAID from the menu
(see Figure 5-40). Press the F10 key
to save your changes and reset.

3. When the system reboots, enter BIOS/UEFI again. On the Advanced page, select Intel(R) Rapid Storage
Technology. Notice that in the information area, the three drives are recognized, and their current status
is Non-RAID Disk.
4. Select Create RAID Volume. On the next screen, shown in Figure 5-41, enter a RAID volume name
(FileServer1 in our example).
5. Under RAID Level, select RAID5 (Parity). Select disks to use in the RAID configuration.
6. Select the value for the Strip Size. (This is the amount of space devoted to one strip across the striped
array. Choices are 32 KB, 64 KB, or 128 KB.)
7. Enter the size of the volume. You don’t have to use all the available space. The space you don’t use can
later be configured as another array.
8. Select Create Volume to complete the RAID configuration. Be warned that if you proceed, all data on all
three hard drives will be lost. The array is created and the system reboots. If you go back into BIOS/UEFI,
you can see the RAID 5 volume is set up; see Figure 5-42.
You are now ready to install Windows. Windows has built-in hardware RAID drivers and therefore automatically
“sees” the RAID array as a single 500 GB hard drive. After Windows is installed on this one logical drive, Windows
will call it volume C:.

Troubleshooting Hard Drive Installations
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.3
Sometimes trouble crops up during an installation. Keeping a cool head, thinking things through carefully several
times, and using all available resources will most likely get you out of any mess.
Installing a hard drive is not difficult unless you have an unusually complex situation. For example, your first
hard drive installation should not involve the extra complexity of installing a RAID array. If a complicated installation
is necessary and you have never installed a hard drive, ask for expert help.
The following list describes errors that cropped up during a few hard drive installations; the list also includes
the causes of the errors and what was done about them. Everyone learns something new when making mistakes,
and you probably will, too. You can then add your own experiences to this list:
●● When first turning on a previously working computer, Temuulen received the following error message:
“Hard drive not found.” She turned off the machine, checked all cables, and discovered that the data
cable from the motherboard to the drive was loose. She reseated the cable and rebooted. POST found
the drive.

●● Lucia physically installed a new hard drive, replaced the cover on the computer case, and booted the
computer with a Windows setup DVD in the drive. POST beeped three times and stopped. Recall that
diagnostics during POST are often communicated by beeps if the tests take place before POST has
checked video and made it available to display the messages. Three beeps on some computers signal a
memory error. Lucia turned off the computer and checked the memory modules on the motherboard.
A module positioned at the edge of the motherboard next to the cover had been bumped as she
replaced the cover. She reseated the module and booted again, this time with the cover still off. The error
disappeared.
●● Jason physically installed a new hard drive and turned on the computer. He received the following error:
“No boot device available.” He had forgotten to insert a Windows setup DVD. He put the disc in the drive
and rebooted the machine successfully.
●● The hard drive did not physically fit into the bay. The screw holes did not line up. Juan got a bay kit, but it
just didn’t seem to work. He took a break, went to lunch, and came back to make a fresh start. Juan asked
others to help him view the brackets, holes, and screws from a fresh perspective. It didn’t take long to
discover that he had overlooked the correct position for the brackets in the bay.
Applying Concepts Continued
Caution
When things are not going well, you can tense up and make mistakes more easily. Be certain to turn off the
machine before doing anything inside! Not doing so can be a costly error. For example, a friend had been trying
and retrying to boot for some time and got frustrated and careless. They plugged the power cord into the drive
without turning the computer off. The machine began to put off an electrical odor, and everything went dead.
The next thing they learned was how to replace a power supply!
Troubleshooting Hard Drives
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 5.3
In this section of the module, you learn how to troubleshoot problems with hard drives. Hard drive problems during
the boot can be caused by the hard drive subsystem, the file system on the drive, or files required by Windows when
it begins to load. The LED status indicator on a hard drive is the start to identifying whether a hard drive is failing.
To understand the color coding or blinking patterns, refer to the hard drive or laptop manufacturer documentation.
Generally speaking, a green light means the hard drive is functioning correctly, and an amber light means the hard
drive has failed and needs replacing. When trying to solve a problem with the boot, you need to decide if the problem
is caused by hardware or software. All the problems discussed in this section are caused by hardware.
Slow Performance
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 5.3
One of the most common complaints about a computer is that it is running slowly. In general, the overall performance
of a system depends on the individual performances of the processor, motherboard, memory, and hard drive; often,
the hard drive (for example, a 5400 RPM magnetic drive) or the hard drive interface (SATA Revision 2.x, for example)
is the bottleneck.

To run a command in Windows, enter the command (for example, dfrgui) in the Windows search box.
Note 13
If not managed well, hard drives can run slower over time, and full hard drives run slower than others. For best
performance, don’t allow an SSD to exceed 70% capacity and a magnetic drive to exceed 80% capacity.
You can use Windows tools or tools provided by the hard drive manufacturer to optimize a drive. To diagnose
an issue with hard drive performance, such as extended or slow read/write times, use a hard drive speed test utility
program that includes IOPS measurements. Microsoft recommends using DISKSPD. You can download and install
DISKSPD to test your hard drive performance at this website: https://github.com/Microsoft/diskspd.
Windows Automatically Optimizes a Drive
First, let’s understand why performance might slow down for magnetic drives and SSDs:
●● Magnetic drives. When a magnetic drive is new, files are physically written in contiguous sectors (one
following another without a break). Over time, as more files are written and deleted, files are stored in
disconnected fragments on the drive, and slow performance can result. To improve performance, every
week Windows automatically defragments a magnetic drive, rearranging fragments—or parts of files—in
contiguous clusters.
●● SSDs. For SSDs, data is organized in blocks, and each block contains many pages. A file can spread over
several pages in various blocks. Each time a new page is written to the drive, the entire block to which it
belongs must be read into a buffer, erased, and then rewritten with the new page included. When a file is
deleted, information about the file is deleted, but the actual data in the file is not erased. This can slow
down SSD performance because the unused data must still be read and rewritten in its block. To improve
performance, Windows sends the trim command to an SSD to erase a block that no longer contains useful
data so that a write operation does not have to manage the data. Once a week, Windows also sends a retrim
command to the SSD to erase all blocks that are filled with unused data.
You can use the Windows Defrag and Optimization tool (dfrgui.exe) to verify that Windows is defragmenting a
magnetic drive and trimming an SSD. Run the dfrgui command in Windows to open the Optimize Drives window,
which reports the status of each drive installed in the system (see Figure 5-43). To verify the settings, click Change
settings. If a drive has not been recently optimized, select the drive, and then click Optimize.
Figure 5-43 Windows reports volume C: is trimmed and volume D: is not fragmented

Drive Manufacturer Utilities
Most magnetic drive and SSD manufacturers offer free utilities you can download and use to update drive firmware
and optimize and troubleshoot a drive. For example, Intel offers the Intel Memory and Storage Tool for its SSDs,
Seagate has SeaTools for its magnetic drives and SSDs, and Kingston offers SSD Manager for its drives. Search the
manufacturer website to find and download the tools and get other hard drive support.
Migrating Data to a New SSD in a Laptop
You can migrate data to a new SSD if you need more storage space, to improve performance, or if you suspect a
failing hard drive due to data loss or corruption. When you upgrade to a new SSD from a magnetic hard drive, you
can migrate data from an old hard drive to the new SSD without reinstalling Windows, copying all your data files, or
losing your system configuration. Recreating the system configuration onto the new hard drive is called disk cloning.
When looking to purchase an SSD for a laptop to use in a data migration, consider the following:
●● The SSD needs to be just as large or larger as the old hard drive.
●● The SSD type needs to be compatible with the system board connector. Many laptops with a standard hard
drive have a 2.5 inch SATA drive, which should be replaced with a 2.5 inch SATA SSD.
●● The quality of the SSD needs to be considered for the performance and activity of the laptop. Read several
reviews and tests of SSDs to find an appropriate drive.
●● Purchase a SATA-to-USB data transfer cable; see Figure 5-44.
●● Access cloning software to perform the migration. Your new SSD or SATA-to-USB cable might include a
free download to cloning software. If neither does, then you can find several free disk-cloning programs
online.
To perform the migration, complete the following steps:
1. Install the cloning software on your laptop.
2. Attach the SATA-to-USB data transfer cable to
a USB port on your laptop. The USB 3.x ports
offer the best transfer speeds.
3. Attach the new SSD to the SATA-to-USB data
transfer cable.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions in the
cloning software to complete the data
migration.
5. Remove the old hard drive, and install the
new SSD into the laptop.
6. Install the drive management software from
the SSD manufacturer to keep the SSD drive
firmware up to date.
Hard Drive Problems During the Boot
Core 1 Objective 5.3
Hardware problems usually show up at POST unless there is physical damage to an area of the hard drive that is not
accessed during POST. Hardware problems often make the hard drive totally inaccessible. If BIOS/UEFI cannot find
a hard drive at POST, it displays an error message similar to one of the following. Most likely, the error message is
in white text on a black background.
No boot device available
Hard drive not found
OS not found
Read/write failure

S.M.A.R.T. errors during the boot
If BIOS/UEFI cannot access the drive, the cause might be the drive, the data cable, the electrical system, the
motherboard, or a loose connection. Here is a list of things to do and check before you open the case:
1. If BIOS/UEFI displays numeric error codes or cryptic messages during POST, check the website of
the motherboard manufacturer for explanations of these codes or messages, or do a general Google search.
2. Check BIOS/UEFI setup for errors in the hard drive configuration. If you suspect an error, set BIOS/ UEFI
to default settings, make sure autodetection is turned on, and reboot the system.
3. Try booting from other bootable media such as the Windows setup DVD or a USB flash drive or CD with
the Linux OS and diagnostics software installed. You learn more about this in a project at the end of this
module. If you can boot using other media, you have proven that the problem is isolated to the hard
drive subsystem. You can also use the bootable media to access the hard drive, run diagnostics on the
drive, and possibly recover its data.
4. For a RAID array, use the firmware utility to check the status of each disk in the array and to check for
errors. Press a key at startup to access the RAID BIOS/UEFI utility. This utility lists each disk in the array
and its status. You can search the website of the motherboard or RAID controller manufacturer for an
interpretation of the messages on this screen and what to do about them. If one of the disks in the array
has gone bad, it might take some time (as long as two days for large-capacity drives) for the array to
rebuild using data on the other disks. In this situation, the status for the array is likely to show as Caution.
After the array has rebuilt, your data should be available. However, if one of the hard drives in the array has
gone bad, you need to replace the hard drive. After you have replaced the failed drive, you must add it back to the
RAID array. This process is called rebuilding a RAID volume. How to do this depends on the RAID hardware you are
using. For some motherboards or RAID controller cards, you use the RAID firmware. For others, you use the RAID
management software that came bundled with the motherboard or controller. You install this software in Windows
and use the software to rebuild the RAID volume using the new hard drive.
If the problem is still not solved, open the case and check the following things. Be sure to protect the system
against ESD as you work:
1. Remove and reattach all drive cables.
2. If you’re using a RAID or SATA controller card, remove and reseat it or place it in a different slot. Check
the documentation for the card, looking for directions for troubleshooting.
3. Inspect the drive for damage, such as bent pins on the cable or drive connection.
4. Determine if a magnetic hard drive is spinning by listening to it or lightly touching the metal drive (with
the power on).
5. Check the cable for frayed edges or other damage.
6. Check the installation manual for things you might have overlooked. Look for a section about system
setup, and carefully follow all directions that apply.
7. S.M.A.R.T. errors that display during the boot result from BIOS/UEFI reporting that the drive has met a
threshold point of failure. Back up the data, and replace the drive as soon as possible.
8. When Windows is installed on a hard drive but cannot launch, it might present a blue screen with error
messages, called a blue screen of death (BSOD), or it might hang and display a never-ending, spinning
Windows pinwheel or wait icon. Windows includes several tools for checking a hard drive for errors
and repairing a corrupted Windows installation, as you learn in the module “Troubleshooting Windows
Startup.” Without getting into the details of supporting Windows, here are a few simple things you can try:

a. Use Windows Startup Repair. In the module “Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer
Problems,” you learned that the Startup Repair utility restores many of the Windows files needed for
a successful boot. Following directions given in that module, boot from the Windows setup DVD or
flash drive, select the option to Repair your computer, and perform a Startup Repair.
b. Use the chkdsk command. To make sure the hard drive does not have bad sectors that can corrupt
the file system, you can use the chkdsk command. The command works from Windows, but if you
cannot start Windows from the hard drive, you can use the command after booting the system from
Windows setup media and selecting the option to Repair your computer. Then go to the Advanced
options screen (see Figure 5-45). Next, select Command Prompt. At the command prompt that
appears, run this chkdsk command to search for bad sectors on drive C: and recover data:
chkdsk C: /r
Figure 5-45 Select Command Prompt, where you can execute the chkdsk
command
Early in the boot, BIOS/UEFI error messages usually display in white text on a black screen. Windows BSOD boot error
messages display on a blue screen. As an IT help desk technician, you might find yourself talking on the phone with
a customer about their boot problem. To help you decide if the problem is happening during POST or as Windows is
loading, ask the customer to tell you the color of the screen that shows the error message.
Note 14
9. Before Windows can format and install a file system on a drive, it first separates the drive into one
or more partitions using the older Master Boot Record (MBR) or newer GPT (GUID [Globally Unique
Identifier] Partition Table) partitioning system. Here are steps you can take to repair an MBR hard drive:
a. Repair the BCD. The BCD (Boot Configuration Data) is a small database that holds parameters Windows
needs for a successful boot. At a command prompt, enter this bootrec command to rebuild the BCD:
bootrec /RebuildBCD
b. Repair the boot sector. The first sector of a hard drive is called the boot sector and holds the MBR
partition table, which maps the locations of partitions on the drive. To repair a corrupted boot
sector, run this command:
bootrec /FixBoot
c. Repair the MBR. The bootrec command can be used to fix problems with the MBR program in the
boot sector that is needed to start Windows. Enter this command:
bootrec /FixMBR

10. Check the drive manufacturer’s website for diagnostic software such as SeaTools, which is used to
diagnose problems with Seagate drives. Sometimes these types of software, including SeaTools, can be
run from a bootable USB flash drive or CD. Run the software to test the drive for errors.
11. If it is not convenient to create a bootable USB flash drive or DVD with hard drive diagnostic software
installed, you can move the drive to a working computer and install it as a second drive in the system.
Then you can use the diagnostic software installed on the primary hard drive to test the problem drive.
While you have the drive installed in a working computer, be sure to find out if you can copy data from it
to the good drive so that you can recover any data not backed up (if the hard drive is encrypted, you’ll
need the recovery password to access the data). Remember that you set the drive on the open computer
case (see Figure 5-46) or use a SATA-to-USB converter to connect the drive to a USB port. If you have the
case open with the computer turned on, be very careful not to put your hands inside the case.
12. After you have tried to recover the file system and data on the drive and before you decide to replace the
hard drive, try these things to clean the drive and get a fresh start:
a. Format a hard drive volume. If you decide the hard drive volume is corrupted and you want to start
over, boot the system from Windows setup media and open a Windows command prompt. Then run the
format command to erase everything on
the volume. In this example, D: is the drive
letter for the volume:
format D:
b. Use diskpart to start over with a fresh
file system. If formatting the volume
doesn’t work, you can erase the hard
drive partitions using the diskpart
command. When you enter diskpart
at a command prompt, the DISKPART>
prompt appears. Then run the following
commands to wipe everything off the
hard drive. In the example, you are
erasing partition 1 on disk 0.
list disk
select disk 0
list partition
select partition 1
clean
Enter the exit command to exit the
diskpart utility. You can then reinstall Windows, which partitions the hard drive again. If Windows
cannot recognize the drive, it’s probably time to replace hardware in the hard drive subsystem.
13. If the drive still does not boot, exchange the three field replaceable units—the data cable, the storage
card (if the drive is connected to one), and the hard drive itself—for a hard drive subsystem. Do the
following, in order, and test the hard drive after each step:
a. Try connecting the drive data cable to a different SATA connector on the motherboard. A SATA
connector might be disabled when the system is using an M.2 slot.
b. Reconnect or swap the drive data cable.
c. Reseat or exchange the drive controller card, if one is present.
d. Exchange the hard drive for a known good drive.
14. Sometimes older drives refuse to spin at POST or a failing drive can make a loud clicking or grinding
noise. Drives that have trouble spinning often whine at startup for several months before they finally
refuse to spin altogether. If your drive whines loudly when you first turn on the computer, do not turn
off the computer; immediately back up the data. Then replace the drive. One of the worst things you can
do for a drive that has difficulty starting is to leave the computer turned off for an extended period of

time. Some drives, like old cars, refuse to start if they are unused for a long time. A drive making a loud
clicking or grinding noise most likely is not accessible and must be replaced.
15. A bad power supply or a bad motherboard also might cause a disk boot failure.
If the problem is solved by exchanging the hard drive, take the extra time to reinstall the old hard drive and
verify that the problem was not caused by a bad connection.
Now let’s move on to other types of storage devices, including optical drives and flash cards.
Supporting Other Types of Storage Devices
Core 1 Objective 3.3
Before we explore the details of several other types of storage devices—including optical discs, USB flash drives,
and memory cards—let’s start with the file systems they might use.
File Systems Used by Storage Devices
Core 1 Objective 3.3
A storage device—such as a hard drive, CD, DVD, USB flash drive, or memory card—uses a file system to manage
the data stored on the device. A file system is the overall structure the operating system uses to name, store, and
organize files on a drive. In Windows, each storage device or group of devices, such as a RAID array, is treated as a
single logical drive. When Windows first recognizes a new logical drive in the system, it determines which file system
the drive is using, assigns it a drive letter (for example, C: or D:), and calls it a volume. Use Explorer to see volumes
and devices in Windows (see Figure 5-47). To see information about the volume or device, right-click it and select
Properties from the shortcut menu. The device or volume Properties dialog box appears, which shows its file system
and storage capacity (see the right side of Figure 5-47).
Figure 5-47 This 16 GB USB flash drive is using the FAT32 file system
Using Windows to install a new file system on a device or logical drive is called formatting, a process that erases
all data on the device or drive. One way to format a device is to right-click it and select Format from the shortcut
menu. In the dialog box that appears, you can select the file system that works for this device (see Figure 5-48). If
you have problems with a device, make sure it’s using a file system appropriate for your situation:

●● NTFS (New Technology file system) is primarily used by hard drives.
●● The exFAT file system is used by large-capacity removable storage devices, including some USB flash drives,
memory cards, and external hard drives.
●● FAT32 and FAT file systems are used by smaller-capacity devices.
●● CDFS (Compact Disc File System) or the UDF (Universal Disk Format) file system is used by CDs.
●● A newer version of the UDF file system is used by DVDs and BDs (Blu-ray discs).
Now let’s look at the types of optical drives you might be called on to support.
Standards Used by Optical Discs and Drives
Core 1 Objective 3.3
CDs (compact discs), DVDs (digital versatile discs or digital video discs), and BDs (Blu-ray discs) use similar laser
technologies. Tiny lands and pits on the surface of a disc represent bits, which a laser beam can read. This is why
they are called optical storage technologies.
Optical Discs
Data is written to only one side of a CD, but it can be written to one or both sides of a DVD or Blu-ray disc. Also, a
DVD or Blu-ray disc can hold data in two or more layers on each side. For example, a dual-layer, double-sided DVD
can hold a total of four layers on one disc (see Figure 5-49).
Figure 5-49 A DVD can hold data in double layers on both the top and bottom
of the disc, yielding a maximum capacity of 17 GB

Optical Drives and Burners
Blu-ray drives are backward compatible with DVD and CD technologies, and DVD drives are backward compatible
with CD technologies. Depending on the drive features, an optical drive might be able to read and write to BDs,
DVDs, and CDs. A drive that can write to discs is commonly called a burner. Today’s internal optical drives interface
with the motherboard by way of a SATA connection. An external drive might use an eSATA or USB port. Figure 5-51
shows an internal DVD drive, and Figure 5-52 shows an external DVD drive.

Windows supports optical drives using its own embedded drivers without add-on drivers. Therefore, when
Windows first starts up after the drive is installed, it recognizes the drive and installs drivers. Use Device Manager
to verify that the drive is installed with no errors and is ready to use.
Solid-State Storage
Core 1 Objective 3.3
Types of solid-state storage include SSDs,
USB flash drives, and memory cards. Current USB flash drives range in size from
256 MB to 2 TB and go by many names,
including a flash pen drive, jump drive,
thumb drive, and key drive. Several USB
flash drives are shown in Figure 5-56. Flash
drives might work at USB 2.0 or USB 3.x
speed and use the FAT (for small-capacity
drives) or exFAT file system (for largecapacity drives). Windows has embedded
drivers to support flash drives. To use one,
simply insert the device in a USB port. It
then appears in Explorer as a drive with an
assigned letter.
Figure 5-55 Slide the drive into the bay flush with the front panel
Figure 5-56 USB flash drives come in a variety of styles and
sizes
To make sure that data written to a flash drive is properly saved, right-click the drive in Explorer, and select Eject from
the shortcut menu. It is then safe to remove the drive.
Note 17
Memory cards might be used in digital cameras, tablets, smartphones, MP3 players, digital camcorders, and
other portable devices, and most laptops have memory card slots provided by a built-in smart card reader. If there is
not a memory card slot in the device, you can add an external smart card reader/writer that uses a USB connection.
For a desktop, you can install a universal smart card reader/writer in a drive bay. For a laptop or desktop, you can
use an external USB memory card reader. For example, both devices shown in Figure 5-57 read and write to several
types of smart cards. The first device plugs into an external USB 3.0 port. The second device installs in a desktop

9-pin USB 2.0 header on the motherboard.
The most popular memory cards are Secure Digital (SD) cards, which follow the standards of the SD Association (sdcard.org) and are listed in Table 5-3. The four standards for capacity used by SD cards are 1.x (regular SD),
2.x (SD High Capacity or SDHC), 3.x (SD eXtended Capacity or SDXC), and 7.x (SD Ultra Capacity or SDUC). Besides
capacity, SD cards come in three physical sizes (full-size, MiniSD, and MicroSD) and are rated for speed in classes.

Popular classes for rating speeds, from slowest to fastest, are Speed Class C2, C4, C6, and C10; Ultra High Speed
Class 1 (U1) and U3; Video Speed Class 6 (V6), V10, V30, V60, and V90. For digital cameras, class 4 or 6 should be fast
enough. For high-resolution video recording, use class 10 or higher. To know the class rating, look for a symbol (see Figure 5-59) on the card. Generally, the higher the speed, the more expensive the card becomes. For SD cards rated in UHS
or Video Speed classes, the device must also be rated for UHS or Video Speed, respectively, to get the higher speeds.
The SDUC card technology was developed and announced by the SD Association in 2018; however, demand for production hasn’t met the market yet, so SDUC cards are absent from retail supply. The SDUC card can theoretically hold
2 TB up to 128 TB of memory.

Figure 5-58 shows several flash SD memory cards together so you can get an idea of their relative sizes. Sometimes a memory card is bundled with one or more adapters so that a smaller card will fit a larger card slot.
SD slots are backward compatible with earlier standards for SD cards. However, you cannot use an SDHC card
in an SD slot, and you cannot use an SDXC card in an SDHC slot or SD slot. Only use SDUC cards in SDUC slots.
SD and SDHC cards use the FAT file system, whereas SDXC and SDUC cards use the exFAT file system. Windows
supports both file systems, so you should be able to install an SD, SDHC, SDXC, or SDUC card in an SD slot on a
Windows laptop with no problems (assuming the slot supports the SDHC, SDXC, or SDUC card you are using).
Memory cards other than SD cards are shown in Table 5-4. Some of the cards in the table are seldom used today.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about memory cards. Given a scenario, you need to know which type of flash
storage device is appropriate for the situation.

Module Summary
Hard Drive Technologies and Interface Standards
●● A hard disk drive (HDD) can be a magnetic drive or a solid-state drive. A magnetic drive comes in two sizes:
3.5" for desktop computers and 2.5" for laptops.
●● A solid-state drive contains NAND flash memory and is more expensive, faster, more reliable, and uses less
power than a magnetic drive. Form factors used by SSDs include 2.5", mSATA, M.2, and PCIe cards.
●● Hard drive performance is measured by throughput, IOPS, and latency.
●● S.M.A.R.T. is a self-monitoring technology whereby the BIOS/UEFI monitors the health of the hard drive and
warns of an impending failure.
●● Interface standards used by hard drives and optical drives include the outdated IDE and SCSI standards,
SATA (the most popular standard), and NVMe (applies only to SSDs and the fastest standard).
●● The three SATA standards provide data transfer rates of 1.5 Gb/sec (using SATA Revision 1.x), 3 Gb/sec (using
SATA Revision 2.x), and 6 Gb/sec (using SATA Revision 3.x).
●● The NVMe standard can be used by SSDs embedded on PCIe expansion cards, SSDs using a U.2/U.3 connector, and SSD M.2 cards using an M.2 slot.
How to Select and Install Hard Drives
●● When selecting a hard drive, consider the interface standards, storage capacity, technology (solid-state or
magnetic), form factor, spindle speed (for magnetic drives), and interface standard.
●● SATA drives require no configuration and are installed using a power cord and a single SATA data cable.
Flash Memory Device Example
CompactFlash (CF) cards were popular among early memory cards
but are quickly being replaced by faster cards with higher capacities.
CF cards come in two types: Type I and Type II. Type II cards are
slightly thicker. The CF standard allows for sizes up to 512 GB.
XQD cards are the successor to CF cards, introducing the PCIe
2.0 standard as the interface. XQD cards are still used in high-end
cameras today, but they already have a successor: CFexpress.
CFexpress cards offer faster data transfer because they are
designed using the PCIe 3.0 interface standard. CFexpress comes in
three form factors: A, B, and C. The larger form factors offer more
PCIe lanes to be used. The form factor B is compatible with XQD card
slots, making it the more popular successor. The form factor A is
compatible with SD card slots.

●● Laptop hard drives plug directly into a SATA connection on the system board.
●● RAID technology uses an array of hard drives to provide fault tolerance and/or improved performance. The
following are choices for RAID:
■ RAID 0 (striping using two drives and improves performance)
■ RAID 1 (mirroring using two drives and provides fault tolerance)
■ RAID 5 (parity checking using three drives; provides fault tolerance and improves performance)
■ RAID 10 (striping and mirroring combined using four drives; provides optimum fault tolerance and
performance)
●● Hardware RAID is implemented using the motherboard BIOS/UEFI or a RAID controller card. Software RAID
is implemented in Windows. The best practice is to use hardware RAID rather than software RAID.
Troubleshooting Hard Drives
●● Defragmenting a magnetic hard drive can sometimes improve slow performance of the drive. Trimming an
SSD improves performance.
●● Hard drive problems during the boot can be caused by the hard drive subsystem, the file system on the
drive, or the files required by Windows when it begins to load. After the boot, bad sectors on a drive can
cause problems with corrupted files.
●● To determine if the hard drive is the problem when booting, try to boot from other media, such as the
Windows setup DVD or a bootable USB flash drive.
●● For problems with a RAID volume, use the RAID controller firmware (on the motherboard or on the RAID
controller card) or RAID management software installed in Windows to report the status of the array and
to rebuild the RAID volume.
●● To determine if a drive has bad sectors, use the chkdsk command. You can run the command after booting
the system using Windows setup media.
●● Use the format command to erase everything on a Windows volume.
●● Use commands within the diskpart utility to completely erase a partition on a hard drive.
●● Field replaceable units in the hard drive subsystem are the data cable, optional storage card, and hard drive.
Supporting Other Types of Storage Devices
●● File systems a storage device might use in Windows include NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, FAT, CDFS (used by CDs),
and UDF (used by CDs, DVDs, and BDs).
●● CDs, DVDs, and BDs are optical discs with data physically embedded into the surface of the disc. Laser
beams are used to read data off the disc by measuring light reflection.
●● Optical discs can be recordable (such as a CD-R disc) or rewriteable (such as a DVD-RW disc). A BD-R QL
(Blu-ray disc quad-layer) can hold 128 GB.
●● Flash memory cards are a type of solid-state storage. Types of flash memory card standards by the SD
Association include SD, MiniSD, MicroSD, SDHC, MiniSDHC, MicroSDHC, SDXC, MicroSDXC, SDUC, and
microSDUC. Other memory cards include CompactFlash, XQD, and CFexpress.

Real Problems, Real Solutions
Using Speccy to Inspect Your System
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objectives: 3.3, 5.3
In a project at the end of the module “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory,” you downloaded and installed
Speccy at ccleaner.com/speccy. If Speccy is not still installed, install it now. Run it to inspect your system, and answer
the following questions:
1. What is the manufacturer and product family of your primary hard drive? What is the capacity of the drive?
Is the drive magnetic or SSD?
2. Looking at the S.M.A.R.T. data reported by Speccy, how many read errors has S.M.A.R.T. reported? Of
the many drive attributes that S.M.A.R.T. monitors, has it reported a status other than good? If so, which
attributes have led to problems?
3. Which SATA type is your hard drive using?
4. For your optical drive, which read capabilities does the drive support? Which write capabilities does the
drive support?
5. List three ways Speccy might be able to help you when troubleshooting hard drive problems.
Hands-On Project 5-6
Recovering Data
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 5.3
Your friend has a Windows 10 desktop system that contains important data. They frantically call you to say that when
they turn on the computer, the lights on the front panel light up, they can hear the fan spin for a moment, and then
all goes dead. The most urgent problem is the data on the hard drive, which is not backed up. The data is located in
several folders on the drive. What is the quickest and easiest way to solve the most urgent problem, recovering the
data? List the major steps in that process.
Real Problem 5-1
Using Hardware RAID
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.3
You work as an IT support technician for a manager who believes you are really bright and can solve just about any
problem that is thrown at you. Folks in the company have complained one time too many that the file server downtime is just killing them, so your manager asks you to solve this problem. Your task is to figure out what hardware
is needed to implement hardware RAID for fault tolerance.

Creating a Bootable Ubuntu USB Drive
Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.3
Every IT technician who works on personal computers needs a bootable USB flash drive or DVD in their toolkit to
use when they cannot boot from the hard drive. If you can boot from other media, you have proven the problem
is not the motherboard, processor, or memory, and you can turn your attention to the hard drive subsystem and
Windows. In this project, you create an Ubuntu bootable USB flash drive, called a Live USB. (A live Ubuntu flash drive
or disc can boot and launch Ubuntu from the drive without changing anything on the hard drive.) You’ll need at least
4 GB of free space (more is recommended) on a USB flash drive that has been formatted with the FAT32 file system.
Follow these steps to create and test the drive:
1. Go to ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows and follow the directions to download the latest
Ubuntu desktop OS to your USB flash drive.
2. Your Live USB can have persistent storage, which means that you can write files to the Ubuntu flash
drive, and the files will still be there next time you launch Ubuntu from the drive. Note: If you want to use
persistent storage, consider using a much larger-capacity (at least 32 GB) USB drive to have room for any
application or files you want to store on the USB drive. Research how to create a live Ubuntu USB drive with
persistent storage. What benefits does persistent storage have for you as an IT technician?
3. You can boot from the flash drive on this or another computer to launch Ubuntu. First, make sure the BIOS/
UEFI boot priority is set to boot first from the USB drive. Then shut down the system and restart it. Ubuntu
Desktop loads. Hold on to your Live USB drive for another project in the module “Linux and Scripting.”
4. Some systems don’t give the option to boot to a USB drive. For these systems, you’ll need a bootable DVD.
Search the web for directions to create a live Ubuntu bootable DVD. Ubuntu calls this a Live DVD. Which site
gives the best directions?
Real Problem 5-3
You check the file server’s configuration and discover it has a single hard drive using a SATA connection with
Windows Server 2019 installed. There are four empty bays in the computer case and four extra SATA power cords.
You also discover an empty PCIe ×4 slot on the motherboard. BIOS/UEFI setup does not offer the option to configure
RAID, but you think the slot might accommodate a RAID controller.
Complete the investigation and do the following
1. Decide what hardware you must purchase, and save or print webpages showing the products and
their cost.
2. What levels of RAID does the RAID controller card support? Which RAID level is best to use? Cite any
important information in the RAID controller documentation that supports your decisions.
3. What is the total hardware cost of implementing RAID? Estimate how much time you think it will take for
you to install the devices and test the setup.

Introduction
This module is packed full of details about the many I/O (input/output) devices an IT support technician must be
familiar with and must know how to install and support. Most of us learn about new technologies when we need to
use a device or when a client or customer requests our help making a purchasing decision or solving a problem with a
device. Good technicians soon become skilled at searching the web for explanations, reviews, and ads about a device
and can quickly turn to support websites for how to install, configure, or troubleshoot a device. This module can serve
as your jump start for learning about some of the different computer parts and devices used to enhance a system.
It contains enough information to get you started on the path toward becoming an expert with computer devices.
We begin with the basic skills common to supporting any device, including how to use Device Manager and how
to select the right port for a new peripheral device. Then you learn to install I/O devices and adapter cards and to
support the video subsystem. Finally, you learn how to troubleshoot problems with I/O devices.
Basic Principles for Supporting I/O Devices
Core 1 Objective 3.1
An I/O or storage device can be either internal (installed inside the computer case) or external (installed outside the
case and called a peripheral device). These basic principles apply to supporting both internal and external devices:
● Every device is controlled by software. When you install a new device, such as a webcam, you must install
both the device and the device drivers to control it. These device drivers must be written for the OS (operating system) you are using. Recall from earlier modules that the exceptions to this principle are some simple
devices, such as the keyboard, which are controlled by the system BIOS/UEFI. Also, Windows has embedded
device drivers for many devices. For example, when you install a video card, Windows can use its embedded
drivers to communicate with the card, but to use all the features of the card, you can install the drivers that
came bundled with it or download the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.
● When it comes to installing or supporting a device, the manufacturer knows best. In this module, you
learn a lot of principles and procedures for installing and supporting a device, but when you’re on the job
installing a device or fixing a broken one, read the manufacturer’s documentation, and follow those guidelines first. For example, for most installations, you install the device before you install the device drivers.
However, for some devices, such as a wireless keyboard, you might need to install the device drivers first.
Check the device documentation to know which to do first.
● Some devices need application software to use the device. For example, after you install a capture card and its
device drivers, you might also need to install the Wondershare Demo Creator software to use the capture card.
● A device is no faster than the port or slot it is designed to use. When buying a new external device, pay
attention to the type of port for which it is rated. For example, an external hard drive designed to use a USB
2.0 port will work using a USB 3.0 port, but it will work at the USB 2.0 speed even when it’s connected to the
faster USB 3.0 port. As another example, a video card in a PCI slot will not work as fast as a video card in a
PCI Express slot because of the different speeds of the slots.
● Use an administrator account in Windows. When installing hardware devices under Windows, you need to
be signed in to the system with a user account that has the highest level of privileges to change the system.
This type of account is called an administrator account.
● Problems with a device can sometimes be solved by updating the device drivers. Device manufacturers
often release updates to device drivers. Update the drivers to solve problems with the device or to add new
features. You can use Device Manager in Windows to manage devices and their drivers.
● Install only one device at a time. If you have several devices to install, install one and restart the system. Make
sure that device is working and that all is well with the system before you move on to install another device.
Recall that Device Manager (its program file is named devmgmt.msc) is your primary Windows tool for managing hardware. It lists almost all installed hardware devices and the drivers they use. (Printers and many USB devices
are not listed in Device Manager.) Using Device Manager, you can disable or enable a device, update its drivers,
uninstall a device, and undo a driver update (called a driver rollback).

Before we move on to installing devices, you need to be familiar with the ports on a computer. When selecting
a new device, you can get the best performance by selecting one that uses the fastest wired or wireless connection
standard available on your computer.
Wired and Wireless Connection Standards
Used by Peripheral Devices
Core 1 Objective 3.1
When deciding which connection standard to use for a new device, the speed of the transmission standard is
often a tiebreaker. Table 6-1 shows the speeds of various wired and wireless standards, from fastest to slowest. This table can help you decide whether speed
should affect your purchasing decisions—for example, when you are deciding between a USB 2.0 printer
connection and a Bluetooth wireless connection.
Standards for video transmissions are not included
in this table.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to decide the
best connection type given a scenario. Some of the facts
you need to know are found in Table 6-1.

Connectors and Ports Used by Peripheral Devices
Core 1 Objective 3.1
Take a look at the back of a computer, and you’re likely to see a group of ports, several of which you saw in Table 1-1
in the module “Taking a Computer Apart and Putting It Back Together.” In this section of the module, we survey ports
used by a variety of I/O devices and ports used for video, TV, and other specific uses. We begin our survey with USB.
USB Connections and Ports
Here is a summary of important facts you need to know about USB connections:
● The USB Implementers Forum, Inc. (usb.org), the organization responsible for developing USB, uses the
symbols shown in Figure 6-1 to indicate USB4, SuperSpeed1 USB (USB 3.2 and USB 3.1), SuperSpeed USB
(USB 3.0), Hi-Speed USB (USB 2.0), or Original USB (USB 1.1).
Sometimes a mouse that uses USB 2.0 gives problems when plugged into a USB 3.0 port. If a mouse refuses to work
or is unstable, try moving it to a USB 2.0 port.

● As many as 127 USB devices can be daisy-chained together using USB cables. In a daisy chain, one device
provides a USB port for the next device.
● USB uses serial transmissions, and USB devices are hot-swappable, meaning that you can plug in or unplug
one without first powering down the system.
● A USB cable has four wires, two for power and two for communication. The two power wires (one is hot and
the other is ground) allow the host controller to provide power to a device. Four general categories of USB
ports and connectors are USB-C, regular USB, micro USB, and mini USB. Mini USB connectors are smaller
and more durable than micro USB, which are smaller than regular USB connectors. USB4 only uses USB-C
connectors. Table 6-2 shows the different USB connectors on USB cables.

Cable and Connectors Description
A-Male to B-Male cable The A-Male connector on the left is flat and wide and connects to an A-Male
USB port on a computer or USB hub.
The B-Male connector on the right is square and connects to a USB 1.x or 2.0
device such as a printer.
Mini-B to A-Male cable The Mini-B connector has five pins and is often used to connect small electronic
devices to a computer.
A-Male to Micro-B cable The Micro-B connector has five pins and has a smaller height than the Mini-B
connector. It’s used on tablets, cell phones, and other small electronic devices.
A-Male to Micro-A cable The Micro-A connector has five pins and is smaller than the Mini-B connector.
It’s used on cell phones and other small electronic devices.
USB 3.0 A-Male to USB 3.0
B-Male cable
This USB 3.0 B-Male connector is used by SuperSpeed USB 3.0 devices such
as printers or scanners. Devices that have this connection can also use
regular B-Male connectors, but this USB 3.0 B-Male connector will not fit the
connection on a USB 1.1 or 2.0 device. USB 3.0 A-Male and B-Male connectors
and ports are blue.
USB 3.0 A-Male to USB 3.0
Micro-B cable
The USB 3.0 Micro-B connector is used by SuperSpeed USB 3.0 devices. The
connectors are not compatible with regular Micro-B connectors.
USB 3.1 A-Male to USB-C 3.1
cable
The USB-C connector (also called the USB Type-C connector) on the right is
flat with rounded sides and connects to a USB-C port on a computer or device,
such as the latest smartphones or a graphics tablet. USB-C connectors do not
have a specific orientation and are backward compatible with USB 2.0 and
USB 3.0. The connector is required to attain maximum speeds with USB 3.2
devices.

Video Connectors and Ports
Video ports are provided by a video card or the motherboard. Video cards (see Figure 6-2) are sometimes called
graphics adapters, graphics cards, or display cards. Most motherboards sold today have one or more video ports
integrated into the motherboard and are called onboard ports. If you are buying a motherboard with a video port,
make sure that you can disable the video port on the motherboard if it gives you trouble. You can then install a video
card and use its video port rather than the port on the motherboard. Recall that a video card can use a PCI or PCI
Express slot on the motherboard. The fastest slot to use is a PCIe ×16 slot.
A USB 3.0 A-Male connector or port has additional pins compared with USB 1.1 or 2.0 ports and connectors, but it is
still backward compatible with USB 1.1 and 2.0 devices. A USB 3.0 A-Male or B-Male connector or port is usually blue.
Take a close look at the blue and black USB ports shown in Figure 1-16 in the module “Taking a Computer Apart and
Putting It Back Together.”

DVI-I video port
Recall that types of video ports include VGA, DVI, DisplayPort, and HDMI connectors. In addition to these ports,
you also need to know about DVI-I and DVI-D ports. These ports are described here:
● VGA. The 15-pin VGA port is the standard analog video port and transmits three signals of red, green, and
blue (RGB). A VGA port is sometimes called a DB-15 port.
● DVI ports. DVI ports were designed to replace VGA, and variations of DVI can transmit analog and/or digital
data. The DVI standards specify the maximum length for DVI cables as 5 meters, although some video cards
produce a strong enough signal to allow for longer DVI cables.
Here are the variations of DVI:
■ DVI-D. The DVI-D port only transmits digital data. Using an adapter to convert a VGA cable to the port
won’t work. You can see a DVI-D port in Figure 6-3A.
■ DVI-I. The DVI-I port (see Figure 6-3B) supports both analog and digital signals. Analog data is
transmitted using the extra four holes on the right side of the connector. If a computer has this type
of port, you can use a digital-to-analog adapter to connect an older analog monitor to the port using a
VGA cable (see Figure 6-4). If a video card has a DVI port, it most likely will be the DVI-I port (the one
with the four extra holes) so you can use an adapter to convert the port to a VGA port.

● DisplayPort. DisplayPort was designed to replace DVI
and can transmit digital video and audio data. It uses
data packet transmissions similar to those of Ethernet,
USB, and PCI Express and is expected to ultimately
replace VGA, DVI, and HDMI on desktop and laptop
computers. Besides the regular DisplayPort used on
video cards and desktop computers, laptops might
use the smaller Mini DisplayPort. Figure 6-5 shows a
DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable. The maximum
length for DisplayPort cables is 15 meters.
BIOS/UEFI setup can be used to manage onboard
DisplayPort and HDMI ports. For example, Figure 6-6
shows the BIOS screen where you can enable or disable
the audio transmissions of DisplayPort and HDMI ports
and still use these ports for video.
● HDMI connectors. HDMI transmits both digital video
and audio, and it was designed to be used by home theater equipment. The HDMI standards allow for several
types of HDMI connectors. The best known, which is
used on most computers and televisions, is the Type A
19-pin HDMI connector. Figure 6-7 shows a cable with
HDMI and mini HDMI connectors, which is useful when connecting devices like a smartphone to a computer.
Figure 6-8 shows an HDMI to DVI-D cable. The maximum length of an HDMI cable depends on the quality of
the cable; no maximum length has been specified.

Additional Connectors and Ports
Besides USB and video, here are a few other ports and connectors you need to know about:
● Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt is a multipurpose connector used to connect high-end displays and external
storage devices and to provide power for smartphones and laptops (see Figure 6-9). Earlier versions of
268
CompTIA A+: Guide to IT Technical Support

Thunderbolt were limited to Apple products
and used the DisplayPort base connection. The
latest two versions, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3, use the USB-C connection (marked
with a lightning bolt symbol), which opens the
compatibility of Thunderbolt connections to
non-Apple products. The USB-C Thunderbolt
4 and 3 ports can support data transfer rates
up to 40 Gbps.
● eSATA. The eSATA port is used for connecting
external storage devices to a computer (see
Figure 6-10).
● Lightning. The Lightning connector is an
Apple-specific connector for its mobile devices
(see Figure 6-11). It is used to charge mobile
devices, to transfer data, and to connect
peripheral devices, such as a credit card payment device or headphone jack, to the Apple
mobile device. The connector is reversible.
● RS-232. USB or other connectors have replaced
the serial RS-232 connectors once used with
mice, keyboards, dial-up modems, and peripheral connections. However, you might see
a serial RS-232 connector on a rack server
to set up a terminal to access the server. An
earlier version of RS-232 had a 25-pin connector, but all RS-232 connectors today use nine
pins and are often called DB-9 connectors (see
Figure 6-12).
Now that you know about the connection
standards, ports, and connectors for external
devices, let’s see how to install them.

Identifying and Installing I/O Peripheral Devices
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 1.2, 3.4
Installing peripheral or external devices is easy and usually goes without a hitch. All devices need device drivers or
BIOS/UEFI to control them and to interface with the OS. Simple input devices, such as the mouse and keyboard, can
be controlled by the BIOS/UEFI or have embedded device drivers built into the OS. For these devices, you usually
don’t have to install additional device drivers.
Peripheral devices you might be called on to install include keyboards, mice, touch pads, touch screens, microphones, digitizers, webcams, and display devices. These installations are similar, so learning to do one will help you
do another. Here are the general procedures to install any peripheral device:
1. Read the manufacturer’s directions. I know you don’t want to hear that again, but when you follow
these directions, the installation goes smoother. If you later have a problem with the installation and you
ask the manufacturer for help, being able to say you followed the directions exactly as stated goes a long
way toward getting more enthusiastic help and cooperation.
2. Make sure the drivers provided with the device are written for the OS you are using. Recall that 64-bit
drivers are required for a 64-bit OS, and 32-bit drivers are required for a 32-bit OS. You can sometimes use
drivers written for older Windows versions in newer Windows versions, but for best results, use drivers
written for the OS installed. You can download the drivers you need from the manufacturer’s website.
3. Make sure the motherboard port you are using is enabled. It is most likely enabled, but if the device
is not recognized when you plug it in, go into BIOS/UEFI setup and make sure the port is enabled. In
addition, BIOS/UEFI setup might offer the option to configure a USB port to use USB4, SuperSpeed1
(USB or 3.2 or 3.1), SuperSpeed (USB 3.0), Hi-Speed USB (USB 2.0), or original USB (USB 1.1). Refer
back to Figure 6-6, which shows the BIOS setup screen for one system where you can enable or disable
onboard devices. In addition, if you are having problems with a motherboard port, don’t forget to update
the motherboard drivers that control the port.
4. Install drivers or plug in the device. Some devices, such as a USB printer, require that you plug in the
device before installing the drivers, and some devices require you to install the drivers before plugging
in the device. For some devices, it doesn’t matter which is installed first. Carefully read and follow the
device documentation. For example, the documentation for one scanner says that if you install the
scanner before installing the drivers, the drivers will not install properly.
If you plug in the device first, Device Setup launches and steps you through the installation of
drivers (see Figure 6-13). As Device Setup works, an icon appears in the taskbar. To see the Device Setup
dialog box, as shown in the figure, click the icon.

If you need to install the drivers first, run the setup program on CD or DVD. If you downloaded
drivers from the web, double-click the driver file and follow the directions on-screen. It might be
necessary to restart the system after the installation. After the drivers are installed, plug the device into
the port. The device should immediately be recognized by Windows. If you have problems using the
device, turn to Device Manager for help.
5. Install the application software to use the device. For example, a USB camcorder is likely to come
bundled with video-editing software. Run the software to use the device.
Now let’s look at some key features and any specific installation concerns for several peripheral devices.
Mouse or Keyboard
Core 1 Objective 1.1
When you plug a mouse or keyboard into a USB port, Windows should immediately recognize it and install generic drivers. (Older computers used PS/2 ports for the mouse and keyboard. Because these ports were not hot-pluggable, you
had to restart Windows after plugging in a mouse or keyboard.) For keyboards with special features such as the one
shown in Figure 6-14, you need to install the drivers that came with the keyboard before you can use these features.
Figure 6-14 The mouse and keyboard require drivers to use the extra buttons and

You can use Device Manager to uninstall, disable, or enable most devices. However, USB devices are managed
differently. To uninstall a USB device such as a USB graphing tablet, use the Programs and Features window or the
Apps & features window. To open the Windows 10 Apps & features window, right-click the Start button, select Apps
and Features, and then select the device and click Uninstall. See Figure 6-15. Follow the directions on-screen to
uninstall the device.

Replace a Key or the Keyboard and Touch Pad in a Laptop
When individual keys are broken, you can replace just the key fairly easily. Before you begin any disassembly of a
laptop, refer to the manufacturer documentation. Follow these standard steps that are similar for many models of
laptops:
1. Slide a small flathead screwdriver underneath the key cap to hold down the key retainer clip, and then
pull up on the key cap.
2. If the key retainer clip is broken, pop it off and replace it, being careful to not pull on the rubber cup.
3. Pop a new key cap on the key retainer clip.
Replacing the whole keyboard is pretty easy, too. Always follow the steps provided by the manufacturer when
disassembling a laptop. Here are the steps for a Lenovo laptop that are similar for many models of laptops:
1. Power down the laptop, and remove the AC adapter and the battery pack.
2. Remove two or more screws on the bottom of the laptop. (Only the manufacturer documentation can tell
you which ones because there are probably several used to hold various components in place.)
3. Remove the lid on the bottom of the laptop to expose the keyboard ribbon cable attached underneath
the board. Use a screwdriver, spudger, or tweezers to lift the cable connector up and out of its socket
(see Figure 6-16).
Figure 6-15 USB devices are listed as installed programs
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to use Control Panel in Classic view, which presents a list of individual items. If Control
Panel is in Category view, which presents items in groups, you can get Classic view by clicking Category and then clicking Small icons or Large icons.

6. Replace the keyboard following the steps in reverse order.
Sometimes the touch pad and keyboard are one complete field replaceable unit (FRU). If the touch pad is a
separate component, it might be part of the keyboard bezel, also called the palm rest. This bezel is the flat cover that
surrounds the keyboard. You most likely have to remove the keyboard before you can remove the keyboard bezel.
Webcams
Core 1 Objective 1.2
A webcam (web camera) is embedded in most laptops and can also be installed as a peripheral device using a USB
port or some other port. For example, the webcam shown in Figure 6-19 works well for personal chat sessions and videoconferencing and has a built-in microphone. First, install the software, and then plug in the webcam to a USB port.
Figure 6-18 Lift the keyboard from the case
Figure 6-19 This personal web camera clips to the top of
your laptop and has a built-in microphone
A webcam comes with a built-in microphone. You can use this microphone or the microphone port on the computer. Most software for using a webcam and microphone allows you to select these input devices. For example,
Figure 6-20 shows the input options for VCam by XSplit (xsplit.com).

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Graphics Tablets
Core 1 Objective 1.2
Another input device is a graphics tablet, also called a
digitizing tablet or digitizer, which is used to hand draw.
It is likely to connect using a USB port (see Figure 6-21).
It comes with a stylus that works like a pencil on the tablet
and controls the pointer on the screen. The graphics tablet
and stylus can be a replacement for a mouse or touch pad
on a laptop, and some graphics tablets come with a mouse.
Graphics tablets are popular with graphic artists and other
content creators who use desktop publishing applications.
Install the graphics tablet the same way you do other
USB devices. Additional software might be bundled with the
device to enhance its functions, such as inputting handwritten signatures into Microsoft Word documents.
Installing and Configuring Adapter Cards
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 1.2, 3.4
In this section of the module, you learn to install and configure adapter cards. These types of cards include video
cards, sound cards, network interface cards (NIC), capture cards, and USB expansion cards. The purpose of adding
an adapter card to a system is to add external ports or internal connectors the card provides.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Regardless of the type of card you are installing, be sure to verify and do the following when preparing to
install one:
● Verify that the card fits an empty expansion slot. Recall that there are several PCI and PCI Express standards; therefore, make sure the card will fit the slot. To help with airflow, try to leave an empty slot between
cards. Especially try to leave an empty slot beside the video card, which puts off a lot of heat. PCIe slots
on a motherboard might support different PCIe standards. The motherboard manual tells you which slot is
rated for which PCIe standard.
● Verify that the device drivers for your OS are available. Check the card documentation, and make sure
you have the drivers for your OS. For example, you need to install 64-bit Windows 10 device drivers in a
64-bit installation of Windows 10. You might find drivers to download for your OS from the website of the
card manufacturer.
● Back up important data that is not already backed up. Before you open the computer case, be sure to back
up important data on the hard drive.
● Know your starting point. Know what works and what doesn’t work on the system. Can you connect to the
network and the Internet, print, and use other installed adapter cards without errors? After installing a new
card, verify your starting point again before installing another card.
Here are the general directions to install an adapter card. They apply to any type of card.
1. Read the documentation that came with the card. For most cards, you install the card first and then the
drivers, but some installations might not work this way.
2. If you are installing a card to replace an onboard port, access BIOS/UEFI setup and disable the port.
3. Wear an ESD strap as you work to protect the card and the system against ESD. Shut down the system,
unplug power cords and cables, and press the power button to drain the power. Remove the computer
case cover.
4. Locate the slot you plan to use, and remove the faceplate cover from the slot if one is installed.
Sometimes a faceplate punches or snaps out, and sometimes you have to remove a faceplate screw to
remove the faceplate. Remove the screw in the top of the expansion slot or raise the clip on the top of
the slot. Save the screw; you’ll need it later.
5. Remove the card from its antistatic bag, and insert it into the expansion slot. Be careful to push the card
straight down into the slot without rocking the card from side to side. Rocking the card can widen the
expansion slot, making it difficult to keep a good contact. If you have a problem getting the card into the
slot, resist the temptation to push the front or rear of the card into the slot first. You should feel a slight
snap as the card drops into the slot.
Recall that PCIe ×16 slots use a retention mechanism in the slot to help stabilize a heavy card
(see Figure 6-22). For these slots, you might have to use one finger to push the stabilizer to the side as
you push the card into the slot. Alternately, the card might snap into the slot, and then the retention
mechanism snaps into position. Figure 6-23 shows a PCIe video card installed in a PCIe ×16 slot.
Figure 6-22 A white retention mechanism on a PCIe ×16 slot

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
6. Insert the screw that anchors the card to the top of the slot (see Figure 6-24). Be sure to use this screw. If
it’s not present, the card can creep out of the slot over time, causing a loose connection.
Figure 6-23 A PCIe video card installed in a PCIe ×16 slot

Figure 6-24 Secure the card to the case with a single screw
7. Connect any power cords or data cables the card might use. For example, a video card might have
a 6-pin or 8-pin PCIe power connector for a power cord from the power supply to the card, as shown in
Figure 6-25.
If the power supply does not have the right connector, you can buy an inexpensive adapter to convert a 4-pin Molex
connector to a PCIe connector.

8. Make a quick check of all connections and cables, and then replace the case cover. (If you want, you
can leave the case cover off until you’ve tested the card, in case it doesn’t work and you need to
reseat it.) Plug up the external power cable and essential peripherals.
9. Start the system. When Windows starts, it should detect that a new hardware device is present and
attempt to automatically install the drivers. As the drivers are installed, a message might appear
above the taskbar. When you click the message, the Device Setup dialog box appears (refer back to
Figure 6-13). You can cancel the wizard and manually install the drivers.
Figure 6-25 Connect a power cord to the PCIe power connector on the card

10. Download the drivers from
the manufacturer website,
or insert the CD that came
bundled with the card and
launch the setup program. The
card documentation will tell
you the name of the program
(examples are Setup.exe and
Autorun.exe). Figure 6-26
shows the opening menu for
one setup program for a video
card. Follow the on-screen
instructions to install the
drivers.
All 64-bit drivers must be certified by Microsoft to work in Windows. However, some 32-bit drivers might not be certified. During the driver installation, if you see a message that 32-bit drivers have not been certified, go ahead and give
permission to install the drivers if you obtained them from the manufacturer or another reliable source.

Capture Cards
Core 1 Objective 3.4
A capture card is a peripheral device or an expansion card used to record and stream content from an external
device, such as a gaming console or webcam. Capture cards are primarily used by video game streamers. Some
capture cards use a PCIe port on the motherboard. Figure 6-28 shows a capture card by AVerMedia (avermedia.com).
11. After the drivers are installed, you might be asked to restart the system. Then you can configure the
card or use it with application software. If you have problems with the installation, turn to Device
Manager and look for errors reported about the device. The card might not be properly seated in
the slot.
Now let’s turn our attention to types of cards you might be called on to install. As with any adapter card you
install, be sure to become familiar with the user guide before you start the installation so you know the card’s hardware and software requirements and what peripheral devices it supports.
Sound Cards and Onboard Sound
Core 1 Objective 3.4
A sound card (an expansion card with sound
ports) or onboard sound (sound ports embedded on a motherboard) can play and record
sound and save it in a file. Figure 6-27 shows
a sound card by Creative (creative.com). This
Sound Blaster card uses a PCIe ×1 slot and supports up to eight surround sound speakers.
The color-coded speaker ports are for these
speakers: front left and right, front center, rear
left and right, subwoofer, and two additional
rear speakers. The two SPDIF (Sony-Philips
Digital InterFace) ports are used to connect
to external sound equipment such as a Blu-ray
disc player.

If you are using a single speaker or two speakers with a single sound cable, connect the cable to the lime-green sound
port on the motherboard, which is usually the middle port.

After installing a capture card, you can download and use the proprietary software that comes with the card, or
you can choose third-party software. Third-party software is usually more robust than proprietary software offered
by the manufacturer. Windows 10 offers Xbox Game Bar for recording (see Figure 6-30). To open Microsoft Xbox
Game Bar, press the Windows key1G.
Another type of capture card is a peripheral device that connects to the computer using a USB, USB-C, or Thunderbolt port. Capture cards have a passthrough between the source of content (e.g., a gaming console or camera)
and the display, typically using HDMI in/out connections. The data is sent via the passthrough to the computer to
record and stream (see Figure 6-29). Some capture cards also offer ports for input from a microphone and output
to a headset.

Replacing Expansion Cards in a Laptop
Core 1 Objective 1.1
A laptop does not contain the normal PCI Express or PCI slots found in
desktop systems. Many laptops provide Mini PCI Express slots (also called
Mini PCIe slots) that use the PCI Express standards applied to laptops.
Mini PCI Express slots use 52 pins on the edge connector. These slots can
be used by many kinds of Mini PCIe cards. These cards are often used to
enhance communications options for a laptop, including Wi-Fi wireless,
video, and Bluetooth Mini PCIe cards. Figure 6-31 shows a Mini PCI Express
card by Sierra Wireless that provides mobile broadband Internet.
For many laptops, you can remove a cover on the bottom to expose
expansion cards so that you can exchange them without an extensive disassembly. For example, to remove the cover on the bottom of one Lenovo
laptop, first remove several screws, and then lift the laptop cover up and
out. Several internal components are exposed, as shown in Figure 6-32.
The half-size Mini PCIe wireless Wi-Fi card shown in Figure 6-33 has
two antennas. To remove the card, first disconnect the black and the
gray antenna wires, and remove the one screw shown in the photo. Note
the black and white triangles labeled with a 1 and a 2 on the label of the
card so you know which wire goes on which connector when replacing
the card. Typically, the black antenna wire goes to the black triangle, and
the gray antenna wire goes with the white triangle. Then slide the card
forward and out of the slot. You can then install a new card.

Supporting the Video Subsystem
Core 1 Objectives 1.2, 3.1, 3.4
The primary output device of a computer is the monitor. The two necessary components for video output are the
monitor and the video card (also called the video adapter and graphics card) or a video port on the motherboard.
In this section of the module, you learn about monitors and how to support the video subsystem.
Monitor Technologies and Features
Core 1 Objectives 1.2, 3.1
The most popular type of monitor for laptop and desktop systems is an LCD flat-screen monitor (see Figure 6-35),
but you have other choices as well. Here is a list and description of each type of display:
● LCD monitor. The LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, also called a flat-panel monitor, was first used
in laptops. The monitor produces an image using a liquid crystal material made of large, easily polarized
molecules. Figure 6-36 shows the layers of the LCD panel that together create the image. At the center of

the layers is the liquid crystal material. Next to it is the layer responsible for providing color to the image.
These two layers are sandwiched between two grids of electrodes forming columns and rows. Each intersection of a row electrode and a column electrode forms one pixel on the LCD panel. Software can address
each pixel to create an image.
The following are the three common types of LCD monitors:
■ Twisted nematic (TN). Twisted nematic (TN) monitors are the oldest type of LCD monitor and are
still widely popular because they are inexpensive and easy to produce. They have lowest latency and
highest refresh rates among LCD monitors. The viewing angles and color range of TN monitors are
lacking.
■ In-plane switching (IPS). In-plane switching (IPS) monitors improved on TN monitors in terms of
viewing angles and color range. In addition, IPS monitors provide the most accurate color and the best
LED (light-emitting diode) backlighting for viewing photography; however, these types of monitors also
have an “IPS glow” at extreme viewing angles. IPS monitors, which are quickly closing the gap with TN
monitors in latency and refresh rates, are the most expensive option.
■ Vertical alignment (VA). Vertical alignment (VA) monitors are a compromise between TN and IPS
monitors. VA monitors are ideal for general use and in TVs. They offer the best contrast ratio and
picture depth. VA monitors offer better color range than TN monitors, and they do not have the IPS
glow. They have poor latency, which creates motion blur or ghosting on fast-moving pictures, making
them unpopular among competitive gamers.
● OLED monitor. An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) monitor uses a thin LED (light-emitting diode) layer
or film between two grids of electrodes and does not use backlighting. It does not emit as much light as an
LCD monitor and, therefore, can produce deeper blacks, provide better contrast, work in darker rooms, and
use less power than an LCD monitor. On the other hand, LCD monitors give less glare than OLED monitors.
OLED screens are primarily used by mobile devices and other portable electronic devices. OLED monitors
are available for desktop systems but are significantly more expensive than LCD monitors.

● Projector. A digital projector (see Figure 6-37) shines a light that projects a transparent image onto a large
screen and is often used in classrooms or with other large groups. Several types of technologies are used by
projectors, including LCD. A projector is often installed as a dual monitor on a computer, which you learn
how to do later in the module.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to compare LCD and OLED monitor types and choose which one is the best fit for a
given scenario.
Although a laptop display almost always uses LCD technology, laptops that use an OLED display are available.
Some laptop LCD panels use LED backlighting to improve display quality and conserve power. For desktops, LCD is
by far the most popular monitor type. Figure 6-38 shows an ad for one best-selling LCD monitor. Table 6-3 explains
the features mentioned in the ad.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about the components within the display of a laptop, including the components used in LCD and OLED displays. You also need to know about backlighting and the function of an inverter.

Monitor Characteristic Description
Screen size The screen size is the diagonal length of the screen surface in inches.
Refresh rate The refresh rate is the number of times a monitor screen is built or refreshed in
1 second, measured in Hz (cycles per second). The ad in Figure 6-38 shows the monitor
refresh rate as 60 Hz (60 frames per second)—the higher, the better. Related to refresh
rate, the response time is the time it takes to build one frame, measured in milliseconds
(ms)—the lower, the better. The ad in Figure 6-38 shows a response time of 5 ms.
Pixel pitch A pixel is a spot or dot on the screen that can be addressed by software. The pixel pitch is
the distance between adjacent pixels on the screen—the smaller the number, the better.
Resolution The resolution is the number of spots or pixels on a screen that can be addressed by
software. Values can range from 640 × 480 up to 7680 × 4320 for high-end monitors. Popular
resolutions are 1280 × 720 and 1920 × 1080. The resolution in Figure 6-38 is 1920 × 1080.
Contrast ratio Contrast ratio is the contrast between true black and true white on the screen—the
higher the contrast ratio, the better. 1000:1 is better than 700:1.
An advertised dynamic contrast ratio is much higher than the contrast ratio, but it is not
a true measurement of contrast. Dynamic contrast adjusts the backlighting to give the
effect of an overall brighter or darker image. For example, if the contrast ratio is 1000:1,
the dynamic ratio is 20,000,000:1. When comparing quality of monitors, pay more
attention to the contrast ratio than the dynamic ratio.
Viewing angle The viewing angle is the angle at which a monitor becomes difficult to see from the side.
A viewing angle of 170 degrees is better than 140 degrees.
Backlighting or
brightness
Brightness is measured in cd/m2 (candela per square meter), which is the same as
lumens/m2 (lumens per square meter).
Connectors Popular options for connectors are VGA, DVI-I, DVI-D, HDMI, DisplayPort, and
Thunderbolt. Some monitors offer more than one connector (see Figure 6-39).
Other features LCD monitors can also provide a privacy or antiglare surface, tilt screens, microphone input,
speakers, USB ports, adjustable stands, and perhaps even an input for your smartphone.
Some monitors are also touch screens, so they can be used with a stylus or finger touch.

Now let’s see how to configure a monitor or dual monitors connected to a Windows computer.
Changing Monitor Settings
Core 1 Objective 1.2
Settings that apply to the monitor can be managed by using the monitor buttons, function keys on a keyboard,
and Windows utilities. Using the monitor buttons, you can adjust the horizontal and vertical position of the
screen on the monitor surface and change the brightness and contrast settings. Adjust these settings to correct a distorted image. For laptops, the brightness and contrast settings can be changed using function keys
on the laptop.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about monitor features such as refresh rate, resolution, brightness in lumens,
and connectors used.
Caution
If you spend many hours in front of a computer, you may strain your eyes. To protect your eyes from strain, look away
from the monitor into the distance every few minutes. Use a good monitor with a high refresh rate or low response
time. The lower refresh rates that cause monitor flicker can tire and damage your eyes. When you first install a monitor,
set the refresh rate at the highest value the monitor can support.
Installing Dual Monitors
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 1.2
To increase the size of your Windows desktop, you can install more than one monitor for a single computer. To install
dual monitors, you need two video ports on your system, which can come from motherboard video ports, a video
card that provides two video ports, or two video cards.
To install a second monitor in a dual-monitor setup using two video cards, follow these steps:
1. Verify that the original video card works properly, and decide whether it will be the primary monitor.
2. Boot the computer and enter BIOS/UEFI setup. If BIOS/UEFI setup has the option to select the order in
which video cards are initialized, verify that the currently installed card is configured to initialize first.
For example, for the BIOS/UEFI system in Figure 6-40, the video adapter in the PCIe slot initializes first
before other video adapters. If it does not initialize first and you install the second card, video might not
work at all when you first boot with two cards.

3. Install a second video card in an empty slot. A computer might have a second PCIe slot or an unused PCI
slot you can use. Attach the second monitor.
4. Boot the system. Windows recognizes the new hardware and launches Device Setup. You can use the
utility to install the video card drivers or cancel the utility and install them manually, as you learned to do
earlier in the module.
Here are the steps to configure dual monitors:
1. Connect two monitors to your system. In Windows 10, open the Settings app, and click the System
group. The display settings appear, as shown in Figure 6-41.

2. Notice the two numbered boxes that represent your two monitors. When you click one of these boxes,
the settings shown apply to the selected monitor, and the screen resolution and orientation (Landscape,
Portrait, Landscape flipped, or Portrait flipped) follow the selected monitor. This lets you customize
the settings for each monitor separately. If necessary, use drag-and-drop to arrange the boxes so they
represent the physical arrangement of your monitors.
If you see both numbered displays in the same box, the Multiple displays setting is set to Duplicate these
displays. To separate the displays, change the Multiple displays setting to Extend these displays. Then click
Keep changes.
Note 7
In Figure 6-41, if you arrange the two boxes side by side, your extended desktop will extend left or right. If you
arrange the two boxes one on top of the other, your extended desktop will extend up and down.
Note 8
3. Adjust the screen resolution according to your preferences. The highest resolution is most often the best
resolution for the monitor.
4. The Multiple displays setting allows you to select how to handle multiple displays. You can extend your
desktop onto the second monitor, duplicate displays, or disable the display on either monitor. To save the
settings, click Keep changes. The second monitor should initialize and show the extended or duplicated
desktop.
5. Close the Settings app. For an extended desktop, open an application and verify that you can use the
second monitor by dragging the application window over to the second monitor’s desktop.
After you add a second monitor to your system, you can move from one monitor to another simply by moving your mouse over the extended desktop. Switching from one monitor to the other does not require any special
keystroke or menu option.
Most laptop computers are designed to be used with projectors and provide a VGA, DisplayPort, or HDMI port
for this purpose. To use a projector, plug it in to the extra port, and then turn it on. For a laptop computer, use a
function key to activate the video port and toggle between extending the desktop to the projector, using only the
projector, duplicating the screen on the projector, or not using the projector. When giving a presentation, most
people prefer to see it duplicated on the LCD screen and the projector.
For group presentations that require a projector, the most common software used is Microsoft PowerPoint.
If you configure your projector as a dual monitor, you can use PowerPoint to display a presentation to your
audience on the projector at the same time you are using your LCD display to manage your PowerPoint slides.
To do so, select the Slide Show tab in PowerPoint. In the Set Up group, click Set Up Slide Show. In the Set Up
Show box under Multiple monitors, check Use Presenter View and click OK.

Troubleshooting I/O Devices
Core 1 Objectives 1.2, 3.4, 5.4
A computer usually has so many types of peripheral devices that you’ll probably troubleshoot at least one of each at
some point in your technical career. When this happens, always try the least invasive and least expensive solutions
first. For example, try updating drivers of a graphics tablet before replacing it. Now let’s learn how to handle some
of the errors or problems you might encounter.
Numlock Indicator Light
Core 1 Objective 5.4
If a user complains they cannot sign in to Windows even when they are certain they are entering the correct password, ask them to make sure the NumLock key is set correctly. Laptops use this key to toggle between the keys
interpreted as letters and numbers. Most laptops have a NumLock indicator light near the keyboard.
Device Manager
Core 1 Objectives 3.4, 5.4
Device Manager is usually a good place to start troubleshooting. A Device Manager window is shown on the left side
of Figure 6-42. Click a white arrow to expand the view of an item and click a black arrow to collapse the view. Notice
the yellow triangle beside the SM Bus Controller, which indicates a problem with this motherboard component.
To see a device’s properties dialog box, right-click the device and click Properties.
First try updating the drivers. Click Update Driver on the General tab or the Driver tab. If a driver update creates a problem, you can roll back (undo) the update if the previous drivers were working. (Windows does not save
drivers that were not working before the driver update.) If you are still having a problem with a device, try uninstalling it and installing it again. To uninstall the device, click Uninstall on the Driver tab. Then reboot and reinstall the
device, looking for problems during the installation that point to the source of the problem. Sometimes reinstalling
a device is all that’s needed to solve the problem.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
If Windows is not able to locate new drivers for a device, locate and download the latest driver files from the
manufacturer’s website to your hard drive. For the SB Bus Controller, you would download the chipset drivers from
the motherbaord manufacturer’s website. Be sure to use 64-bit drivers for a 64-bit OS and 32-bit drivers for a 32-bit
OS. If possible, use Windows 10 drivers for Windows 10, and Windows 11 drivers for Windows 11. You can doubleclick the downloaded driver files to launch the installation.
Update Port or Slot Drivers on a Laptop
If you ever have a problem with a port or slot on a laptop, first turn to Device Manager to see if errors are reported
and to update the drivers for the port or slot. The laptop manufacturer has probably stored backups of the drivers
on the hard drive under support tools and on the recovery media if available. You can also download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website. If the problem is still not solved after updating the drivers, try using Device
Manager to uninstall the port or slot drivers, and then use the support tools to reinstall the drivers.
If a port or slot on a desktop or laptop fails even after updating the drivers, you can install an external device to replace
the port or slot. For example, if the network port fails, you can purchase a USB to Ethernet adapter dongle to connect
an Ethernet cable to the system using a USB port.
Note 10
Audio Issues
Core 1 Objective 5.4
You’re trying to play a video or listen to music, and you know sound should be coming out of the speakers, but they
are quiet. When you’re having audio issues, there are a few things you can try:
1. Make sure volume is turned up.
2. Check all audio cables, plugs, jacks, speakers, and headphone connections.
3. Update audio drivers.
If you continue to struggle getting audio to play, the issue might not be with hardware. Microsoft offers some
guidance to troubleshoot audio issues using Windows 10 tools here: support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/
fix-sound-problems-in-windows-10-73025246-b61c-40fb-671a-2535c7cd56c8.
Note 11
Troubleshooting Video, Monitors, and Projectors
Core 1 Objective 5.4
For monitor and video problems, as with other devices, try doing the easy things first. For instance, try to make
simple hardware and software adjustments. Many monitor problems are caused by poor cable connections or bad
contrast/brightness adjustments. Typical monitor and video problems and how to troubleshoot them are described
next. Then, you learn how to troubleshoot video problems on laptop computers.
A user very much appreciates a support technician who takes a little extra time to clean a system being serviced. When
servicing a monitor, take the time to clean the screen with a soft, dry cloth or monitor wipe.

Blurry Image
A fuzzy or blurry image on the screen can be quite frustrating and can strain your eyes if you stare at the screen for
hours. Try these three steps when dealing with a blurry screen:
1. Clean the screen with an electronics-safe cleaning wipe or cloth.
2. Set your monitor resolution to its native or recommended resolution.
3. Check your cable connections. If you are using a VGA cable with an LCD monitor, it might create a
blurry image. Upgrade to a digital connection using DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort to optimize the video
connection.
Problems with Video Card Installations
When you install a video card, here is a list of things that can go wrong and what to do about them:
● When you first power up the system, you hear a whining sound. This is caused by the card not getting
enough power. Make sure a 6-pin or 8-pin power cord is connected to the card if it has this connector. The
power supply might be inadequate.
● When you first start up the system, you see nothing but a black screen. This is most likely caused by the
onboard video port not being disabled in BIOS/UEFI setup. Disable the port.
● When you first start up the system, you hear a series of beeps. BIOS/UEFI cannot detect a video card. Make
sure the card is securely seated. The video slot or video card might be bad.
● Error messages about video appear when Windows starts. This can be caused by a conflict between
onboard video and the video card. Try disabling onboard video in Device Manager.
● Games crash or lock up. Try updating drivers for the motherboard, the video card, and the sound card. Also
install the latest version of DirectX. Then try uninstalling the game and installing it again. Then download
all patches for the game.
Monitor Indicator Light Is Not On; No Image on Screen
If you hear one or no beep during the boot and you see a blank screen, then BIOS/UEFI has successfully completed
POST, which includes a test of the video card or onboard video. You can then assume the problem must be with the
monitor or the monitor cable. Ask these questions and try these things:
1. Is the monitor power cable plugged in?
2. Is the monitor turned on? Try pushing the power button on the front of the monitor. An indicator light
on the front of the monitor should turn on, indicating it has power.
3. Is the monitor cable plugged into the video port at the back of the computer and the connector on the
rear of the monitor?
4. Try a different monitor and a different monitor cable that you know are working.
When you turn on your computer, the first thing you see on the screen is the firmware on the video card identifying
itself. You can use this information to search the web, especially the manufacturer’s website, for troubleshooting
information about the card.
Note 13
Monitor Indicator Light Is On; No Image on Screen
For this problem, try the following:
1. Make sure the video cable is securely connected at the computer and the monitor. The problem is most
likely a bad cable connection.
2. Confirm that the video input source is set to the connector that you have the cable plugged into.

3. If the monitor displays POST but goes blank when Windows starts to load, the problem is Windows
and not the monitor or video. Boot from the Windows setup DVD, and perform a Startup Repair, which
you learned to do in the module “Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer Problems.” If this
works, update the video drivers and verify the display resolution. Other tools for troubleshooting
Windows are covered later in the text.
4. The monitor might have a switch on the back for choosing between 110 volts and 220 volts. Check that the
switch is in the correct position.
5. The problem might be with the video card. If you have just installed the card and the motherboard has
onboard video, go into BIOS/UEFI setup, and disable the video port on the motherboard.
6. Verify that the video cable is connected to the video port on the video card and not to a disabled
onboard video port.
7. Using buttons on the front of the monitor, check the contrast adjustment. If there’s no change, leave it at
a middle setting.
8. Check the brightness or backlight adjustment. If there’s no change, leave it at a middle setting.
9. If the monitor-to-computer cable detaches from the monitor, exchange it for a cable you know is good,
or check the cable for continuity. If this solves the problem, reattach the old cable to verify that the
problem was not simply a bad connection.
10. As a test, use a monitor you know is good on the computer you suspect to be bad. If you think the
monitor is bad, make sure that it also fails to work on a good computer.
11. Open the computer case and reseat the video card. If possible, move the card to a different expansion
slot. Clean the card’s edge connectors using a contact cleaner purchased from a computer supply store.
12. If there are socketed chips on the video card, remove the card from the expansion slot, and then use a
screwdriver to press down firmly on each corner of each socketed chip on the card. Chips sometimes
loosen because of temperature changes; this condition is called chip creep.
13. Trade a good video card for the video card you suspect is bad. Test the video card you think is bad on
a computer that works. Test a video card you know is good on the computer that you suspect is bad.
Whenever possible, do both.
14. Test the RAM on the motherboard with memory diagnostic software.
15. For a motherboard that is using a PCI Express video card, try using a PCI video card in a PCI slot or a
PCIe ×1 video card in a PCIe ×1 slot. A good repair technician keeps an extra PCI video card around for
this purpose.
16. Trade the motherboard for one you know is good. Sometimes, though rarely, a peripheral chip on the
motherboard can cause the problem.
Screen Goes Blank 30 Seconds or One Minute after the Keyboard Is Left Untouched
A “green” motherboard (one that follows energy-saving standards) used with an Energy Saver monitor or projector
can be configured to go into standby or sleep mode after a period of inactivity. Using this feature can also help prevent burn-in. Burn-in is when a static image stays on a monitor for many hours, leaving a permanent impression of
that image on the monitor. An alternate method to avoid burn-in is to use a screen saver that has a moving image or
a rotation of varying images. To wake up the computer, press any key on the keyboard, or press the power button.
Use the Power Options applet in Control Panel to configure the sleep settings on a computer.
Problems might occur if the motherboard power-saving features or the Windows screen saver is turning off the monitor. If the system hangs when you try to get the monitor going again, try disabling one or the other. If this doesn’t work,
disable both.

Poor Display
In general, you can solve problems with poor display by using controls on the monitor and using Windows settings.
Do the following:
● LCD monitor controls. Use buttons on the front of an LCD monitor to adjust color, brightness, contrast,
focus, and horizontal and vertical positions.
● Windows display settings. Use Windows settings to adjust font size, refresh rate, screen resolution, brightness, color, and ClearType text. To adjust display settings in Windows 10, right-click the desktop, and click
Display settings. Here are a few settings:
■ Resolution. The resolution is the number of horizontal and vertical pixels used to build one screen.
In the Resolution drop-down menu, select the highest resolution. If the monitor shows distorted
geometry where images are stretched inappropriately, make sure the resolution is set to its highest
value. Also, a low resolution can cause oversized images or icons.
■ Refresh rate. The refresh rate is the number of times the monitor refreshes the screen in 1 second. To
adjust the refresh rate, click Display adapter properties. On the Monitor tab, select the highest screen
refresh rate available (see Figure 6-43).
Figure 6-43 Use the highest refresh rate the system supports

● Color calibration. If you have an incorrect color display, calibrate colors in Windows. First open the Settings
app, search on calibrate display color, and follow the directions on-screen. As you do so, color patterns
appear (see Figure 6-45). Use these screens to adjust the gamma settings, which define the relationships
among red, green, and blue, as well as other settings that affect the display.
Figure 6-44 ClearType in Windows improves the display of text on the
screen
● ClearType. In Windows 10, open the Settings app, and open the System group to find display settings. To
open the ClearType Text Tuner, search on ClearType in the search box of the Settings app, select Adjust
ClearType text, and check Turn on ClearType (see Figure 6-44). Then follow the steps in the wizard to
improve the quality of text displayed on the screen.

Note 15
Here are a few other display problems and their solutions:
● Dead pixels. An LCD monitor might have pixels that are not working. These dead pixels can appear as small
white, black, or colored spots on your screen. A black or white pixel is likely to be a broken transistor, which
cannot be fixed. Having a few dead pixels on an LCD monitor screen is considered acceptable and usually
is not covered under the manufacturer’s warranty.
● Update the video drivers. The latest video drivers can often solve various problems with the video
subsystem, including poor display.

A problematic pixel might not be a dead pixel (a hardware problem), but only a stuck pixel (a software problem). You
might be able to use software to fix stuck pixels. For example, run the online software at jscreenfix.com to fix stuck pixels.
The software works by rapidly changing all the pixels on the screen. (Be aware the screen flashes rapidly during the fix.)
Note 16
● Dim image. A laptop computer dims the LCD screen when the computer is running on battery power to conserve the charge. You can brighten the screen by using the Windows display settings. In Windows 10, open
the Settings app, click System, and then adjust the brightness slide bar (see Figure 6-41). To check whether
settings to conserve power are affecting screen brightness, open Control Panel in Classic view, and click
Power Options. Note the power plan that is selected. Click Change plan settings for this power plan. On the
next screen, you can adjust when or if the screen will dim (see Figure 6-46). If the problem is still not resolved,
it might be a hardware problem. How to troubleshoot hardware in laptops is covered later in this module.
A dim image in a desktop monitor might be caused by a faulty video card or a faulty monitor. To find
out which is the problem, connect a different monitor. If the LCD monitor is the problem, most likely the
backlighting is faulty and the monitor needs replacing.
Figure 6-46 Change power plan options to affect how or if the screen dims
In this text, we’ve given several options for various freeware utilities. It’s a good idea to know about your options for
several reasons: Each freeware utility has different options, owners of freeware might not update their utilities in
a timely manner, and websites might decide to include adware with their downloads.
Note 17
In general, you can improve video quality by upgrading the video card and/or monitor. Poor display might be
caused by inadequate video RAM. Your video card might allow you to install additional video RAM. See the card’s
documentation.
Cannot Connect to External Monitor or Projector
If the connection to the external monitor or projector fails when you’re setting up dual monitors for a desktop, using
a projector for a presentation, or connecting a monitor to a laptop to troubleshoot video problems with the laptop,
try the following solutions:
1. Make sure the monitor or projector is getting power. Is the power cord securely connected? Is the
electrical outlet working?

2. Check the connection at both ends of the video cable.
3. Is the monitor or projector turned on? For some projectors, a remote control is used to turn on the
projector or wake it from sleep mode. The remote control batteries might be dead and need replacing.
4. Use the Function keys on a laptop to toggle between the laptop display and the external monitor or
projector. (Alternately, you can press Windows key1P to toggle between displays.)
5. Try using a different video cable.
6. Try using a different video connection if the laptop and monitor have another option available.
7. If the projector shuts off unexpectedly, it might have entered sleep mode because of inactivity. Press
the power button to wake the projector. If you can’t wake it, the problem might be overheat shutdown.
Allow the projector lamp to cool down. Make sure the air vents are not obstructed and the room
temperature is not too hot. The air filters inside the projector might be clogged with dust and need
replacing.
Video System in a Laptop
Core 1 Objectives 1.2, 5.4
If the LCD panel in a laptop shows a black screen but the power light indicates that power is getting to the system,
the video subsystem might be the source of the problem. Do the following:
1. Look for an LCD cutoff switch or button on the laptop (see Figure 6-47). The switch must be on for the
LCD panel to work.
Figure 6-47 The LCD cutoff button on a laptop
LCD cutoff button
2. Try to use an onboard video port to connect an external monitor. After you connect the monitor, use
a function key to toggle between the LCD panel, the external monitor, and both the panel and monitor.
If the external monitor works but the LCD panel does not, use the external monitor to check Device
Manager for warnings about the video controller and to update the video drivers.
3. If you still can’t get the LCD panel to work but the external monitor does work, you have proven the
problem is with the LCD panel assembly. In a laptop, a dim screen or no display can be caused by a bad
inverter. Steps to replace the inverter board in a laptop are covered later in the module.

Flickering, Dim, or Otherwise Poor Video
Use these tips to solve problems with bad video:
● Verify Windows display settings. Try using the highest resolution for the LCD panel. This resolution will be
the best available unless the wrong video drivers are installed.
● Try adjusting the brightness, which is a function of the backlight component of the LCD panel.
● Try updating the video drivers. Download the latest drivers from the laptop manufacturer’s website. Bad drivers
can cause an occasional ghost cursor on-screen. A ghost cursor is a trail left behind when you move the mouse.
● If the cursor drifts on the screen when the mouse or touch pad isn’t being used, try using a different port
on the computer or replacing the batteries in the mouse.
● A flickering or flashing screen can be caused by bad video drivers, a low refresh rate, a bad inverter, or
loose connections inside the laptop. After setting the refresh rate to its highest setting, updating the video
drivers, and checking for loose connections, try replacing the inverter.
Replace the Inverter Board in a Laptop
Est. Time: 1 hour
Core 1 Objective: 1.2
Because the LCD panel is so fragile, it is one component that is likely to be broken when a laptop is not handled
properly. For a laptop that uses fluorescent backlighting, the problem might be the inverter if the screen is dim but
some display is still present. The inverter board converts DC to the AC used to power the backlighting of the LCD
panel (see Figure 6-48).
Applying Concepts
Figure 6-48 A ThinkPad inverter board

An LCD assembly might include a microphone, webcam, and speakers that are embedded in the laptop lid. For
other laptops, the microphone and speakers are inside the case. In addition, a Wi-Fi antenna might be in the lid of
the laptop, which is why you should raise the lid if you need a better Wi-Fi signal. To replace the inverter board, you
will likely have to take apart the LCD assembly, as seen in Figure 6-49.
Before you begin any disassembly of a laptop, refer to the manufacturer documentation. The following are some
general directions to replace an inverter board:
1. Remove the AC adapter and the battery pack.
2. Remove the upper keyboard bezel, which is the band around the keyboard that holds it in place. You
might also need to remove the keyboard.
3. Remove the screws holding the hinge in place, and remove the hinge cover. Figure 6-50 shows a laptop
with a metal hinge cover, but some laptops use plastic covers that can easily break as you remove them.
Be careful with the plastic ones.
4. Remove the screws holding the LCD panel to the laptop.
5. You’re now ready to remove the LCD panel from the laptop. Be aware there might be wires running
through the hinge assembly, cables, or a pin connector. Cables might be connected to the motherboard
using ZIF connectors. As you remove the LCD top cover, be careful to notice how the panel is connected.
Don’t pull on wires or cables as you remove the cover, but first carefully disconnect them.

6. Next, remove screws that hold the top cover and LCD panel together. Sometimes, these screws are
covered with plastic or rubber circles or pads that match the color of the case. First use a dental pick
or small screwdriver to pick off these covers. You should then be able to remove the front bezel and
separate the rear cover from the LCD panel. A spudger can help separate the bezel from the case. For
one LCD panel, you can see the inverter board when you separate the LCD assembly from the lid cover.
Figure 6-51 shows the inverter being compared with the new one to make sure they match. The match is
not identical but should work.
7. Disconnect the old inverter, and install the new one. When disconnecting the ribbon cable from the
old inverter, notice you must first lift up on the lock holding the ZIF connector in place, as shown in
Figure 6-52.
8. Install the new inverter. Reassemble the LCD panel assembly. Make sure the assembly is put together
with a tight fit so all screws line up well.
9. Reattach the LCD panel assembly to the laptop.

Module Summary
Basic Principles for Supporting I/O Devices
● Adding new devices to a computer requires installing hardware and software. Even if you generally know
how to install an I/O device, always follow the specific instructions of the product manufacturer.
● Use Device Manager in Windows to manage hardware devices and to solve problems with them.
● Wired data transmission types include USB, eSATA, Thunderbolt, and Lightning. Wireless data transmission
types include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and NFC.
● USB connectors include the A-Male, Micro-A, B-Male, Mini-B, Micro-B, and USB-C.
● Popular I/O ports on a desktop or laptop motherboard include eSATA and USB. Older computers sometimes
used serial RS-232 ports.
● Video ports that a video card or motherboard might provide are VGA, DVI-I, DVI-D, DisplayPort, HDMI, HDMI
mini, and multipurpose Thunderbolt ports.
● Other peripheral connectors and ports include eSATA, Lightning, and RS-232.
Identifying and Installing I/O Peripheral Devices
● Peripheral devices you might be called on to install include keyboards, mice, touch pads, microphones,
digitizers, webcams, and display devices.
● When installing devices, use 32-bit drivers for a 32-bit OS and 64-bit drivers for a 64-bit OS.
Installing and Configuring Adapter Cards
● Generally, when an adapter card is physically installed in a system and Windows starts up, it detects the
card, and then you install the drivers using the Windows wizard. However, always follow specific instructions from the device manufacturer when installing an adapter card because the order of installing the card
and drivers might be different.
● A sound card allows you to input audio and use multispeaker systems.
● A capture card allows you to record and stream content from an external device.
Supporting the Video Subsystem
● Types of monitors include LCD and OLED.
● Technologies and features of LCD monitors include screen size, refresh rate, pixel pitch, resolution, contrast
ratio, viewing angle, backlighting, and connectors that a monitor uses.
● Use the Windows 10 Settings app to configure monitor resolution and to configure dual monitors.
Troubleshooting I/O Devices
● Remember to try simple things first when troubleshooting I/O devices.
● Use Device Manager to update drivers on I/O devices giving trouble.
● Video problems can be caused by the monitor, video cable, video card, onboard video, video drivers, or
Windows display settings.
● A few dead pixels on an LCD monitor screen are considered acceptable by the manufacturer.

Introduction
An A1 support technician needs to prepare to assume total responsibility for supporting both wired and wireless
networks in a small office/home office (SOHO) environment. The first step is to understand how computers, printers, and other devices communicate in a network. Communication happens in layers and involves applications,
operating systems, device drivers, firmware, hardware, and cabling. In this module, you learn about these layers of
communication. You also learn how to set up a simple network and connect it to the Internet.
Understanding TCP/IP and Windows Networking
Core 1 Objectives 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
This section of the module focuses on how a network works. Network communication begins when one application
on one computer tries to find another application on another computer on a local or remote network. Most applications used on the Internet or a local network are client/server applications. Client applications—such as Microsoft
Edge, Google Chrome, or Outlook—usually initiate communication with server applications such as a web server
or email server.
For example, in Figure 7-1, someone uses a web browser (the client) to request a webpage from a web server.
To handle this request, the client computer looks for the web server, the protocols (or rules for communication) are
established, and then the request is made and answered. The application, the OS and hardware on both computers,
and the network are all involved in this process.
Figure 7-1 A web browser (client software) requests a webpage from a web server (server software); the
web server returns the requested data to the client

Both computers are called hosts or nodes on the network:
●● A host is a computer that can be either the client or the server using client/server applications.
●● A node is any computer, printer, smart thermostat, or other networked device that can be addressed on the
network. Every host is a node, but not every node is a host.
Let’s see how computers and networking devices can be addressed on a network.
Addresses Used on a Network
Core 1 Objectives 2.1, 2.5
The following three types of numeric addresses are used for communication on a network:
●● Port address identifies an application. Each client or server application running on a computer is identified
by a port address, also called a port or a port number. For example, a web server receives communication
from a browser at port 80 using the HTTP protocol for unsecured communication and at port 443 using the
HTTPS protocol for secured communication.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● IP address identifies a node and its network connection. An IP address is assigned to a node when the
device first connects to the network, and it identifies the network connection. The following are two types
of IP addresses:
■ A 32-bit string, written as four decimal numbers called octets and separated by periods, such as
192.168.100.4
■ A 128-bit string, written as eight hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, such
as 2001:0000:B80:0000:0000:D3:9C5A:CC
Most networks use 32-bit IP addresses, which are defined by IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4). Some
networks use both 32-bit addresses and 128-bit addresses, which are defined by IPv6 (Internet Protocol
version 6).
●● MAC address identifies a network adapter. Every wired or wireless network adapter, also called a network
interface card (NIC), has a 48-bit (6-byte) identification number—called the MAC address, physical address,
or network adapter address—hard-coded on the card by its manufacturer. Part of the MAC address identifies the manufacturer, who is responsible for making sure that no two network adapters have the same MAC
address. Every device on a network (for example, computers, printers, smart thermostats, refrigerators,
and smartphones) connects to the network by way of its NIC and its MAC address. An example of a MAC
address, written in hexadecimal or hex, is 00-0C-6E-4E-AB-A5. Most likely, the MAC address is printed on
the device (see Figure 7-2). Later in the module, you learn to use the ipconfig command to find out the MAC
address of your installed NIC.
Figure 7-2 This Gigabit Ethernet adapter by Intel uses a PCIe 31 slot
MAC address
Although IP addresses can always be used to identify hosts on a network or the Internet, they are difficult for
humans to remember. Therefore, character-based addresses are preferred:
●● A host name or computer name identifies a host and can be used in place of its IP address on the local network. The name can have up to 63 characters, including letters, numbers, and special characters. Examples
of computer names are www, ftp, JeanAndrews, TestBox3, and RedLaptop. You can assign a computer name
while installing Windows. In addition, you can change the computer name at any time using the About
window in the Settings app. See Figure 7-3.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● A domain name identifies a network. Examples of domain names are the names that appear before the
period in microsoft.com, cengage.com, and mycompany.com. The letters after the period are called the toplevel domain and tell you something about the domain. Examples are .com (commercial), .org (nonprofit),
.gov (government), .edu (education), and .info (general use).
●● A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) identifies a computer and the network to which it belongs. An example
of an FQDN is www.cengage.com. The host name is www (a web server), cengage is the domain name, and
com is the top-level domain name of the Cengage network. Another FQDN is joesmith.mycompany.com.
A fully qualified domain name must be associated with an IP address before the computer can be found on the
Internet. The process of associating a character-based name with an IP address is done via DNS services and is
covered later in this module.
TCP/IP Model for Network Communication
Core 1 Objective 2.1
The suite of protocols or rules that define network communication is called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol). Let’s consider network communication that starts when a browser (an application) requests
a webpage from a web server (another application). As you follow the blue arrows through the diagram, shown in
Figure 7-4, you can see the layers of communication. The browser app passes the request to the OS, which passes
the request to the network card, which passes the request on to the network. When the request reaches the network
card on the server, the network card passes the request on to the OS, and then the OS passes it on to the web server
application.
When studying networking theory, a simple model used to divide network communication into four layers is the
TCP/IP model. In this model, protocols used by hardware function at the Link layer, and protocols used by the OS
are divided into three layers (Internet, Transport, and Application layers). These four layers are shown on the left
and right sides of Figure 7-4 and listed in Table 7-1.

Let’s follow a message from browser to web server, paying attention to each layer of communication:
●● Source Step 1: Application layer. Recall that most applications that use a network are client/server
applications. When a browser client makes a request to a web server, the browser passes the request to
the OS. The OS formats the message using the appropriate application protocol (for example, HTTP, FTP,
Telnet, DNS, and SSH). In our example, an HTTP message is created and passed down in the TCP/IP stack
of protocols to the Transport layer.

Application-to-application communication is managed by the
OS, using protocols specific to the application (HTTP, Telnet,
FTP, and so forth). This layer of communication happens after
the OSs have made a connection at the Transport layer.
Layer 3: Transport
layer
Port addresses Host-to-host communication, managed by the OS, primarily
using TCP and UDP protocols.
Layer 2: Internet layer IP addresses Host-to-host on the local network or network-to-network
communication, managed by the OS and network devices.
Layer 1: Link layer MAC addresses Device-to-device on the local network, managed by firmware
on NICs. Layer 1 is also called the Network interface layer or
Network access layer.

●● Source Step 2: Transport layer. The Transport layer adds information to the message to address the correct
server application. Depending on the type of application, the protocol TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) adds the port assigned to the server application (TCP uses port 80 for
HTTP communication in our example). The message with Transport data added is then passed down to
the Internet layer.
●● Source Step 3: Internet layer. The Internet layer is responsible for getting the message to the destination
computer or host on the local network, an intranet, or the Internet. An intranet is any private network that
uses TCP/IP protocols. A large enterprise might support an intranet that is made up of several local networks. The primary protocol used at the Internet layer is IP (Internet Protocol), which uses an IP address
to identify each host. (Other Internet layer protocols include EIGRP, OSPF, BGP, and ICMP.) IP adds address
information to the message and then passes it down to the Link layer.
●● Source Step 4: Link layer. The Link layer is the physical network, including the hardware and its firmware
for every device connected to the network. A computer’s network interface card (NIC) is part of this physical network. As you know, each NIC is able to communicate with other NICs on the local network using each
NIC’s MAC address. For a local network, the physical connection might be wireless (most likely using Wi-Fi)
or wired (most likely using Ethernet). The NIC receives the message from IP, adds information for Ethernet
or Wi-Fi transmission, and places the message on the network.
●● Step 5: Network transmission. IP at the Internet layer is responsible for making sure the message gets from
one network to the next until it reaches its destination network (see Figure 7-5) and destination computer
on that network. Whereas a MAC address at the hardware Link layer is only used to find a computer or
other host on a local area network (LAN), an IP address can be used to find a computer on a local network,
anywhere on the Internet (see Figure 7-6), or on an intranet.

●● Step 6: Destination. On the destination computer, its NIC receives the message, strips off Ethernet or Wi-Fi
information at the Link layer, and passes the message up to the Internet layer. The Internet layer strips off IP
address information and passes the message up to the Transport layer. The Transport layer strips off TCP
or UDP information and passes the message to the correct port (see Figure 7-7) and on to the Application
layer. The Application layer passes the message to the web server application.
Messages on a TCP/IP network might have different names depending on which layer’s protocols have added information to the message, either at the beginning of the message (called a header) or at the end (called a trailer). For example,
messages with IP address header information added are called packets. Messages with source and destination MAC
addresses are called frames. In general, all of these messages can be referred to with the more technical term protocol
data unit (PDU).

The OSI Model for Network Communication
Core 1 Objective 2.1
A more detailed model for network communication is the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which has
seven layers of communication and is shown on the right side of Figure 7-8. The figure also shows many of the TCP/
IP protocols used by client/server applications, the operating systems, and hardware and how they relate to one
another at the different layers.

As you continue reading the module, Figure 7-8 can serve as your road map to the different protocols. Let’s begin
with the higher-layer application protocols used by server applications.
Server Applications, Their Protocols and Ports
Core 1 Objectives 2.1, 2.4
Recall that a client computer contacts a server in order to request information or perform a task, such as when a
web browser connects with a web server and requests a webpage. Many other types of server resources exist on a
typical network. A server application might be installed on a computer as a stand-alone application or embedded
as firmware in other network devices such as a router. (A router is a device that manages traffic between two or
more networks and can help find the best path for traffic to get from one network to another. You learn more about
routers later in this module.)
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know the port addresses used by many server applications. As you read the list
that follows, pay close attention and even memorize the port addresses used by each server application.
Ports are usually assigned to a client or server app when the app is first installed or configured later after the
installation. For example, Figure 7-9 shows a settings window where the port for an FTP server is set to 21.
Figure 7-9 Configure an FTP server to use the default port 21 or any port between 1 and 65535
Default port is 21
Here’s a brief list of several popular client/server resources used on networks and the Internet along with the
protocols and ports they use:
●● Web server. A web server serves up webpages to clients. Many corporations have their own web servers,
which are available privately on the corporate network. Other web servers are public, accessible from anywhere on the Internet. The most popular web server applications are Apache (see apache.org) and Nginx
(nginx.org). The most popular OSs for running a web server are UNIX and Linux. A web server uses the
following ports and protocols:
■ Port 80. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used by a browser and web server for unsecured
communication. You can see when a browser is using this protocol by looking for “http” at the beginning
of a URL in the address bar, such as http://www.microsoft.com. The web server listens at port 80.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
■ Port 443. HTTPS (HTTP secure) refers to the HTTP protocol working with a security protocol such as
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create a secured socket. (TLS is better
than SSL.) A socket is a connection between a browser and web server. HTTPS is used by web browsers
and servers to secure the socket by encrypting the data before it is sent and then decrypting it on the
receiving end before the data is processed. To know a secured protocol is being used, look for “https”
in the URL, as in https://www.wellsfargo.com. Most websites today use secure protocols.
●● Mail server. Email is a client/server application that involves two mail servers, one to send the mail and
another to deliver an email message to a client app. A mail server uses the following ports and protocols:
■ Port 25. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used to send an email message to its destination (see
Figure 7-10). The email server that takes care of sending email messages (using the SMTP protocol) is
often referred to as the SMTP server. The SMTP server listens at port 25.
Figure 7-10 The SMTP protocol is used to send email to a recipient’s mail server, and the POP3 or
IMAP4 protocol is used by the client to receive email
Receiver’s mail server

SMTP
Sender’s SMTP mail server

POP3 or IMAP4
Port 25
Port 25
Port 110 or
143
■ Port 110 or port 143. After an email message arrives at the destination email server, it remains there
until the recipient requests delivery. The recipient’s email server uses one of two protocols to deliver
the message: POP3 (Post Office Protocol, version 3) or IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol). Using
POP3, email is downloaded to the client computer, and unless the default setting is changed, the email
is then deleted from the email server. The client requests email from a POP3 server listening at port
110. Using IMAP, the client application manages the email while it is still stored on the server. An IMAP
server listens at port 143.
●● File server. A file server, also called a file share server, stores files and makes them available to other computers. Windows uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to share files and printers on a network.
The current release of the SMB protocol is SMB 3; older versions include SMB 2 and a spin-off protocol called
CIFS (Common Internet File System). SMB might use the following ports:
■ Ports 137 and 139. SMB originally worked with NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System), an
older protocol used by Windows for network communication. To support legacy NetBIOS applications
on a TCP/IP network, Windows offered NetBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP). Earlier versions of SMB require
NetBT to be enabled and use these ports:
■ SMB over UDP uses ports 137 and 138.
■ SMB over TCP uses ports 137 and 139.
■ Port 445. Current versions of SMB and CIFS don’t require NetBT and use port 445.

●● Print server. A print server manages network printers and makes them available to computers throughout
the network. You learn more about print servers in the module “Supporting Printers.”
●● DHCP server. When a device first connects to a network, its IP address can have already been manually
assigned; this type of IP address is called a static IP address. Alternately, the device can request an IP
address from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server that assigns the address from a pool
of addresses it maintains; this type of IP address is called a dynamic IP address. A device that requests
an IP address and other information from a DHCP server is called a DHCP client. It is said that the client is
leasing an IP address. A DHCP server that serves up IPv6 addresses is often called a DHCPv6 server. Later
in this module, you learn how to configure a DHCP server embedded in a SOHO router. DHCP uses the
following ports:
■ Port 67. A DHCP server listens at port 67.
■ Port 68. A DHCP client receives messages on port 68.
●● DNS server. DNS servers are part of a client/server system that associates FQDNs such as www.cengage.com
with IP addresses. The process is called name resolution, and it begins when a DNS client, such as a laptop
or workstation, makes a query to its DNS server. The server might turn to other DNS servers to find the IP
address of a given domain name. A DNS server listens at port 53.
●● Proxy server. A proxy server is a computer that intercepts requests that a client, such as a browser, makes
of another server, such as a web server. The proxy server substitutes its own IP address for the request.
It might also store, or cache, data that is used frequently by its clients. An example of using a proxy server is
when an ISP caches webpages to speed up requests for the same pages. After it caches a page and another
browser requests the same content, the proxy server can provide the content that it has cached. In addition,
a proxy server sometimes acts as a router to the Internet, a firewall to protect the network, a filter for email,
and to restrict Internet access by employees to prevent them from violating company policies. When functioning in these ways to give easy access to the Internet, a proxy server is known as an Internet appliance.
●● Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server. An authentication, authorization, and
accounting (AAA) server (pronounced a “triple-A server”) is used to secure and control access to the network and its resources. Active Directory, which is a directory service included in Windows Server, is often
used for these purposes on a Windows domain. AAA servers perform the following tasks:
■ Authenticate users or computers to the network so they can access network resources and stores user
or device credentials, such as user names and passwords.
■ Authorize what a user or computer can do after they have access, including the resources they can
access and what they can do with these resources.
■ Account for what a user or computer did with the resources and the time they took. These logs can be
useful when users and computers are billed for services they used.
One protocol a AAA server can use for communication is LDAP. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP, often pronounced “l-dap”) uses port 389. LDAPS is the secure version of LDAP, and it listens at
port 636.
You learn how to manage a file server in the A1 Core 2 module “Securing and Sharing Windows Resources.”

You learn about other protocols a AAA server can use in the Core 2 module “Network Security and Troubleshooting.”

●● Syslog server. Syslog is a protocol that gathers event information about various network devices, such as
errors, failures, maintenance tasks, and users logging in or out. The messages about these events are sent
to a central location called a syslog server, which collects the events into a database. Some syslog servers
can generate alerts or notifications to inform network administrators of problems that might need attention.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to summarize services provided by several server applications, including
AAA, DNS, DHCP, file share, mail, print, syslog, and web servers.
Exam Tip
FTP has been largely replaced by other technologies, such as the BitTorrent and Streaming Sync protocols, for file
transfers. However, the A1 Core 1 exam still expects you to be familiar with FTP.
You learn more about remotely controlling a computer, including how to use Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance,
in the Core 2 module “Network Security and Troubleshooting.”
Core to Core
●● FTP server. An FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server and the FTP protocol is used to transfer files between
two computers on a network or the Internet. Web browsers can use the protocol, as can File Explorer in
Windows. Also, third-party FTP client software, such as CuteFTP by GlobalSCAPE (globalscape.com/cuteftp)
or open-source FileZilla (filezilla-project.org), offer additional features. By default, FTP transmissions are not
secure. Two protocols that encrypt FTP transmissions are FTPS (FTP Secure), which uses SSL encryption,
and SFTP (SSH FTP), which uses SSH encryption. FTP uses the following ports:
■ Port 20. The FTP client receives data on port 20 from the FTP server.
■ Port 21. The FTP server listens at port 21 for commands from an FTP client.
●● Telnet server. Telnet server and protocol can be used by an administrator or other user to control a computer remotely. Telnet is not considered secure because transmissions in Telnet are not encrypted. The
Telnet server listens at port 23.
●● SSH server. An SSH server and Secure Shell (SSH) protocol encrypt communications so hackers can’t read
the data if they intercept a transmission. The SSH protocol is used in various situations for encryption,
such as when remotely controlling a computer or when communicating with a web server. SSH is commonly
used in Linux to pass sign-in information to a remote computer and control that computer over a network.
Because it’s secure, SSH is preferred over Telnet. SSH uses port 22.
●● Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used by the Windows Remote
Desktop and Remote Assistance utilities to connect to and control a remote computer. These two RDP servers both listen at port 3389.
●● SNMP server and agent. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a versatile service and protocol
used to monitor network traffic and manage network devices. The SNMP server is called the manager, and
a small application called an agent is installed on devices being managed by SNMP. The service can help
create logs for monitoring device and network performance, make some automatic changes to devices
being monitored, and alert network technicians when a bottleneck or other performance issues are causing
problems on the network. SNMP uses the following ports:
■ Port 161. The SNMP agent on the monitored device listens at port 161.
■ Port 162. The SNMP server or manager listens at port 162.

In summary, Table 7-2 lists all the ports you are expected to have memorized in preparation for the A1 Core 1
exam. You need to know the app that uses each port, the purpose of the app, and whether the app uses TCP or UDP
at the Transport layer. TCP and UDP are discussed next.

TCP and UDP Delivery Methods
Core 1 Objective 2.1
Looking back at Figure 7-8, you can see three layers of protocols working at the Application, Transport, and Internet
layers. These three layers make up the heart of TCP/IP communication. As illustrated in the figure, TCP or UDP
manages communication with the applications protocols in the layers above as well as those in the lower layers,
which control communication on the network. TCP
and UDP at the Transport layer are both charged with
delivering an application’s message to the destination
host (refer back to Figure 7-5), but they do their jobs
differently. Let’s discuss next a few key differences
between TCP and UDP that determine which of these
two protocols is most appropriate for each situation.
TCP Guarantees Delivery
Remember that all communication on a network happens by way of messages delivered from one location on a
network to another. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) guarantees message delivery. TCP uses IP addresses to
make a connection between a sending and destination host, sends the data, checks whether
the data is received, and resends it if it is not.
TCP is therefore called a connection-oriented
protocol. TCP is used by applications such as
web browsers (using HTTP and HTTPS protocols), email (using SMTP, POP3, and IMAP
protocols), FTP file transfer apps (using FTP
protocol), and SSH apps used to make secure
connections to a server (using SSH protocol).
Guaranteed delivery takes longer and is used
when it is important to know that the data
reached its destination. When a TCP message
reaches its destination, an acknowledgment is
sent back to the source (see Figure 7-11).
If the source TCP does not receive the
acknowledgment, it resends the data or passes
an error message back to the higher-level
application protocol.
UDP Provides Fast Transmissions
On the other hand, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) does not guarantee delivery by first establishing a connection
or by checking whether data is received; thus, UDP is called a connectionless protocol or best-effort protocol and
is used where guaranteed delivery is not as important as fast transmission. Here are some example uses of UDP:
●● Broadcasting, such as streaming live video or sound over the web. (TCP, however, is preferred for video
on demand where quality is an issue.)
●● Monitoring network traffic. Notice in Table 7-2 the SNMP agent and manager use UDP.
●● Completing simple file transfers. Trivial FTP (TFTP) is a small, simple app often used to transfer BIOS
updates to firmware on routers and smartphones. It’s also used to transfer a lean pre-execution environment
(PXE) operating system from a server to BIOS/UEFI on a computer to boot the computer when it does not
have a working OS. TFTP over UDP is preferred in these situations because the program is small enough to
store on firmware, and it is simple to implement and use.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to contrast
the TCP and UDP protocols.

acknowledgment

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Communicating between DHCP clients and servers. DHCP uses UDP rather than TCP primarily because
DHCP clients and servers use broadcasting to communicate on a local network; UDP supports broadcasting, but TCP does not.
TCP and UDP are responsible for delivering an application’s message, and the IP protocol is responsible for
finding the right destination host. Let’s see how that’s done.
How Computers Find Each Other
Core 1 Objective 2.5
To learn how computers use the IP protocol to find each other on a local network or the Internet, let’s first discuss how IPv4 addresses are constructed and used. A 32-bit IPv4 address is organized into four groups of 8 bits
each, which are presented as four decimal numbers separated by periods, such as 72.56.105.12. The largest possible 8-bit number is 11111111, which is equal to 255 in decimal, so the largest possible IPv4 address in decimal is
255.255.255.255, which in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111. Each of the four numbers separated by
periods is called an octet (for 8 bits) and can be any decimal value from 0 to 255, making a total of about 4.3 billion
possible IPv4 addresses (256 3 256 3 256 3 256). Some IP addresses are reserved, so these numbers are approximations. IP addresses that are reserved for special use by TCP/IP and should not be assigned to a device on a network
are listed in Table 7-3.
IP Address How It Is Used
127.0.0.1 Indicates your own computer and is called the loopback address.
0.0.0.0 Currently unassigned IP address.
255.255.255.255 Used for broadcast messages by TCP/IP background processes to communicate with all
devices on a network at the same time or without needing specific recipient information,
such as when a device broadcasts a message on the local network looking for a DHCP server
from which it can lease an IP address. Broadcasting can cause a lot of network chatter; to
reduce the chatter, subnets are created to subdivide a network into smaller networks so
fewer devices receive and respond to broadcast messages.
Table 7-3 Reserved IP addresses
To communicate on a network or the Internet, a host needs this TCP/IP information:
●● Its own IP address—for example, 192.168.100.4. The first part of an IP address identifies the network, and
the last part identifies the host.
●● A subnet mask, which is four decimal numbers separated by periods—for example, 255.255.255.0. When
a computer wants to send a message to a destination computer, it uses its subnet mask to decide whether
the destination computer is on its own network or another network.
●● The IP address of a default gateway. Computers can communicate directly with each other on the same
network. However, when a computer sends a message to a computer on a different network, it sends the
message to its default gateway, which is connected to the local network and at least one other network.
The gateway sends the message on its way to other networks. For small businesses and homes, the default
gateway is a router.
●● The IP addresses of one or more DNS servers. It queries a DNS server to find out the IP address of the destination host when it knows only the domain name of the host.

Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 2.5
The IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses can be manually assigned to a computer’s
network connection, or this information can be requested from a DHCP server on the network when a computer
first connects to the network. Follow these steps to view the current TCP/IP settings on a Windows 10 computer:
1. Right-click Start and click Network Connections. In the Status window, click Change adapter options.
2. In the Network Connections window, you can see all your connections. Right-click your current
connection, and click Properties (see Figure 7-12).

When TCP/IP receives a message to send to a destination computer, it first looks at the beginning or left part
of its own IP address that identifies the network (called the network ID) and compares it to the network ID of the
destination IP address. On the left side of Figure 7-15, the network ID of the host (192.168.1) matches the network ID
of the destination (192.168.1); therefore, the two computers are on the same network. On the right side of Figure 7-15,
the network ID (192.168.1) of the host does not match the network ID of the destination (9.125.18); therefore, the
host sends the message to its default gateway, which sends the message to a different network.
The network ID of the destination IP address is used to locate the destination host’s local network. After the
message arrives at the local network, the host portion of the IP address is used to identify the one computer on
the network that will receive the message.
Subnet Masks
How does a computer or other network device know
what part of an IP address identifies the network
and what part identifies the host? It relies on a subnet mask for this information. All the IP addresses
assigned to a local network or subnet have matching bits in the leftmost part of the IP address; these

bits that identify the network are called the network ID. For example, the range of IP addresses assigned to a local
network might be 192.168.80.1–100. The first three octets (192.168.80) identify the network and the last octet (1
through 100) identifies each host. The last bits in each IP address that identify the host must be unique for each IP
address on the network.
A subnet mask has 32 bits and is a string of 1s followed by a string of 0s—for example,
11111111.11111 111.11110000.00000000. The 1s in a subnet mask say, “On our network, this part of an IP
address identifies our network,” and the group of 0s says, “On our network, this part of an IP address
identifies each host.” Usually, a subnet mask is displayed in decimal—for example, the subnet mask of
11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000 is 255.255.0.0 in decimal.
Figure 7-16 shows how a subnet mask serves as a type of filter to decide whether a destination IP address is on
the local network or a remote network. In the figure, you can see that the subnet mask has 24 ones. Therefore, the
computer compares the first 24 bits of the destination IP address to its own first 24 bits. If they match, it directs
the message to the computer on its local network. If they don’t match, it sends the message to its default gateway.
Figure 7-16 The subnet mask serves as a filter to decide whether a destination IP address is
on its own network or another network

1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0000 0000
In another example, suppose the IP address of a computer is 201.18.20.160 and the subnet mask is 255.255.0.0,
which is 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000 in binary. The subnet mask tells Windows that the first 16 bits, or
two octets (201.18), of the IP address is the network ID. Therefore, when Windows is deciding how to communicate
with a computer that has an IP address of 201.18.20.208, it knows the computer is on its own network, but a computer
with an IP address of 201.19.23.160 is on a different network.
Let’s look at one more example. Suppose the IP address of a computer is 19.200.60.6 and its subnet mask
is 255.255.240.0. Is a computer with the IP address 19.200.51.100 on its network? Table 7-4 shows the logic to

Yes, they match.
6. Is the other IP address on my network? Yes.
Table 7-4 Logic of a subnet mask
Sometimes an IP address and subnet mask are written using a shorthand notation like 15.50.212.59/20, where
the /20 means that the first 20 bits in the IP address identify the network. This notation is sometimes called slash
notation or CIDR notation (pronounced “cider notation”), named after the CIDR (Classless Interdomain Routing)
standards about subnetting, which were written in 1993.
Public, Private, and Automatic Private IP Addresses
There are a few more special ranges of IP addresses you need to know about. IP addresses available to the Internet are
called public IP addresses. To conserve the number of public IP addresses, some blocks of IP addresses have been designated as private IP addresses, which are not allowed on the Internet. Private IP addresses are used within a company’s
private network, and computers on this network can communicate with one another using these private addresses.
IEEE recommends that the following IP addresses be used for private networks:
●● 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255
●● 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255
●● 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255
IEEE, a nonprofit organization, is responsible for many Internet standards. Standards are proposed to the networking
community in the form of an RFC (Request for Comment). RFC 1918 outlines recommendations for private IP addresses.
To view an RFC, visit the website rfc-editor.org.
Note 3
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to have memorized the private network IP address ranges and automatic private IP
address range.
There’s also a special type of private IP address range. If a computer first connects to a network that is using
dynamic IP addressing and is unable to lease an IP address from the DHCP server, it generates its own Automatic
Private IP Address (APIPA) in the address range 169.254.x.y.

If you are running a web server on the Internet, you will need a public IP address for your router and either a static or
reserved private IP address for the web server. For this situation, you can lease a public IP address from your ISP at
an additional cost. You will also need to enable port forwarding to the server, which is discussed in the Core 2 module
“Network Security and Troubleshooting”.
Core to Core
NAT (Network Address Translation) is a technique designed to conserve the number of public IP addresses
needed by a network. A router stands between a private network and the Internet. It substitutes the private IP
addresses used by computers on the private network with its own public IP address when these computers need
access to the Internet. See Figure 7-17. Besides conserving public IP addresses, another advantage of NAT is security;
the router hides the entire private network behind this one address. For a small office/home office (SOHO) router,
expect that NAT is enabled by default.

How IPv6 Addresses Are Used
Core 1 Objective 2.5
When the Internet and TCP/IP were first invented, it seemed that 32 bits were more than enough to satisfy any needs
we might have for IP addresses because IPv4 created about four billion potential IP addresses. Today we need many
more than four billion IP addresses over the world. Partly because of a shortage of 32-bit IP addresses, IPv6 was
designed to use an IP address with 128 bits. Currently, the Internet uses a mix of 32-bit and 128-bit IP addresses. The
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA at iana.org) is responsible for keeping track of assigned IP addresses
and has already released all of its available 32-bit IPv4 addresses. IPv6 addresses leased from IANA today are all
128-bit addresses.
With the IPv6 standards, more has changed than just the number of bits in an IP address. To improve routing
capabilities and speed of communication, IPv6 changed the way IP addresses are used to find computers on the
Internet. Let’s begin our discussion of IPv6 by looking at how IPv6 addresses are written and displayed:
●● An IPv6 address has 128 bits that are written as eight blocks of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons,
like this: 2001:0000:0B80:0000:0000:00D3:9C5A:00CC.
●● Each block is 16 bits. For example, the first block in the preceding address is 2001 in hex, which can be
written as 0010 0000 0000 0001 in binary.
●● Leading zeroes in a four-character hex block can be eliminated. For example, the preceding IP address can
be written as 2001:0000:B80:0000:0000:D3:9C5A:CC, where leading zeroes have been removed from three of
the hex blocks.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● If blocks contain all zeroes, they can be written as double colons (::). The preceding IP address can be written two ways:
■ 2001::B80:0000:0000:D3:9C5A:CC
■ 2001:0000:B80::D3:9C5A:CC
To avoid confusion, only one set of double colons is used in an IPv6 address. In this example, the preferred
method is the second one: 2001:0000:B80::D3:9C5A:CC because the address is written with the fewest zeroes.
The way computers communicate using IPv6 has changed the terminology used to describe TCP/IP communication. Here are a few terms used in the IPv6 standards:
●● A link is a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).
●● The last 64 bits or four blocks of an IPv6 address identify the interface and are called the interface ID or
interface identifier. These 64 bits uniquely identify an interface on the local network.
●● Neighbors are nodes on the same local network.
Recall that with IPv4 broadcasting, messages are sent to every node on a local network. However, IPv6 doesn’t
use broadcasting, thereby reducing network traffic. Instead, IPv6 uses multicasting, anycasting, and unicasting, as
illustrated in Figure 7-18 and described next:
Figure 7-18 Concepts of broadcasting, multicasting, anycasting,
and unicasting
Broadcasting Multicasting
Anycasting Unicasting
●● A multicast address is used to deliver messages to all nodes in a targeted, multicast group, such as when
video is streaming from a server to multiple nodes on a network.
●● An anycast address is used by routers and can identify multiple destinations; a message is delivered only
to the closest destination.
●● A unicast address is used to send messages to a single node on a network. Three types of unicast addresses
are link local addresses, unique local addresses, and global addresses. A single interface might have more
than one unicast address assigned to it at any given time:
■ A link local address, also called a link local unicast address or local address, can be used for limited
communication with neighboring nodes in the same link (the local network). These local addresses
are similar to IPv4 APIPA addresses in that they are assigned to the computer by itself, as opposed to
coming from a DHCPv6 server, and are not guaranteed to be unique on the network. Most link local
addresses begin with FE80::/64. This prefix notation means the address begins with FE80 followed by
enough zeroes to make 64 bits, as shown in Figure 7-19. Link local addresses are not allowed on the
Internet or allowed to travel outside private networks.

■ Look back at Figure 7-14 to see an example of a link local address where the wired interface has
the IPv6 address of fe80::8944:aa76:727f:4af8%4. The first 64 bits are fe80::, and the interface ID is
8944:aa76:727f:4af8. IPv6 addresses are followed by a % sign and a number; for example, %4 follows this
sample IP address. This number is called the zone ID or scope ID and is used to identify the interface in
a list of interfaces for this computer.
■ A unique local address is a private address assigned by a DHCPv6 server that can communicate across
subnets within the private network. They’re used by network administrators when subnetting a large
network. A unique local address always begins with FC or FD and is usually assigned to an interface in
addition to its self-assigned link local address.
■ A global address, also called a global unicast address, can be routed on the Internet. These addresses are
similar to IPv4 public IP addresses. The first 48 bits of the address is the Global Routing Prefix. When an
ISP assigns a global address to a customer, it’s these 48 bits that are assigned. An organization that leases
one Global Routing Prefix from its ISP can use it to generate many IPv6 global addresses.
Table 7-5 lists the currently used address prefixes for these types of IPv6 addresses. In the future, we can expect
more prefixes to be assigned as they are needed.
IP Address Type Address Prefix
Multicast FF00::/8
(The first 8 bits are always 1111 1111)
Link local address FE80::/64
(The first 64 bits are always 1111 1110 1000 0000 ...)
Unique local address FC00::/7
(The first 7 bits are always 1111 110; today’s local networks assign 1 for the eighth bit,
so the prefix typically shows as FD00::/8)
Global address 2000::/3
(The first three bits are always 001)
Unassigned address 0::0
(All zeroes)

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to understand what a link local address is and how it’s used.
IPv6 uses subnetting but doesn’t need a subnet mask because the subnet ID is part of the IPv6 address. The subnet ID
is the 16 bits following the first 48 bits of the address. When a large IPv6 network is subnetted, a DHCPv6 server assigns
a node in a subnet a global address or unique local address that contains the correct subnet ID for the node’s subnet.
An excellent resource for learning more about IPv6 and how it works is the e-book TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft
Windows. To download the free PDF, search for it at microsoft.com/download.
Note 4
Now that you have an understanding of TCP/IP and Windows networking, let’s turn our attention to the hardware
used for local networks.
Network Hardware
Core 1 Objective 2.2
In this section of the module, you learn about the hardware devices used to create local networks in homes and
small businesses, including network adapters, switches, hubs, cable modems, and SOHO routers.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to compare
and contrast network interface cards, cable modems,
routers, switches and hubs—all discussed in this section
of the module.
Network Adapters
Core 1 Objective 2.2
A computer makes a wired or wireless connection to a local
network by way of a network adapter, which might be a
network port embedded on the motherboard or a network
interface card (NIC) installed in an expansion slot on the
motherboard. In addition, the adapter might be an external
device plugged into a USB port (see Figure 7-20). A network
adapter is often called a network interface card or NIC even
when it’s not really a card but rather a USB device or a device
embedded on the motherboard. It might also be called a network controller or network adapter.

wireless network connections

The speed of a network depends on the speed of each device on the network and how well a router or switch manages
that traffic. SOHO network devices typically offer three speeds: Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps), Fast Ethernet
(100 Mbps), or Ethernet (10 Mbps). If you want your entire network to run at the fastest speed, make sure all your
devices are rated for Gigabit Ethernet.
Note 5
Here are a network adapter’s features you need to be aware of:
●● NIC drivers. A NIC usually comes bundled with drivers on CD or the drivers can be downloaded from
the web. Windows has several embedded NIC drivers. After you install a NIC, you install its drivers. For
best functionality and security, always use the latest drivers. Problems with the network adapter can
sometimes be solved by using Device Manager to update the drivers or uninstall the drivers and then
reinstall them.
●● Ethernet speeds. A NIC supports wired Ethernet transmissions or wireless Wi-Fi transmissions. For wired
networks, the four speeds for Ethernet are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps (Fast Ethernet), 1 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet),
and 10 Gbps (10-gigabit Ethernet). Most network adapters sold today for local networks use Gigabit Ethernet
and support the two slower speeds. To see the speeds a NIC supports, open its Properties dialog box in
Device Manager. Select the Advanced tab. In the list of properties, select Speed & Duplex. You can then
see available speeds in the Value drop-down list (see the right side of Figure 7-21). If the adapter connects
with slower network devices on the network, the adapter works at the slower speed. Select Auto Negotiation
for Windows to use the best possible speed for a particular connection.
●● RJ-45 port and status indicator lights. A network port is called an RJ-45 port, and it looks like a large phone
jack. The RJ-45 Ethernet connector is similar to but larger than the RJ-11 phone connector (see Figure 7-22).
A wired network adapter might provide indicator lights on the side of the network port that indicate connectivity and activity (see Figure 7-23). When you first discover you have a problem with a computer not
connecting to a network, be sure to check the status indicator lights to verify you have connectivity and

activity. If not, then the problem is related to hardware. Next, check the cable connections to make sure
they are solid.
●● Wake-on-LAN. A NIC might support Wake-on-LAN, which allows it to wake up the computer when it receives
certain communication on the network. To use the feature, it must be enabled on the NIC. Open the NIC’s
Properties dialog box in Device Manager, and click the Advanced tab. Make sure Wake on Magic Packet
and Wake on pattern match are both enabled (see Figure 7-24A).
■ For an onboard NIC, you must also enable Wake-on-LAN in BIOS/UEFI setup. Reboot the computer, enter BIOS/
UEFI setup, and look for the option on a power-management or advanced screen. For some systems, such as
the one shown in Figure 7-25, you enable power-on by the PCI-E bus because the NIC communicates via this
bus. It is not recommended that you enable Wake-on-LAN for a wireless network adapter.

●● Quality of Service (QoS). Another feature of a
network adapter is Quality of Service (QoS), the
ability to control which applications’ traffic have
priority on the network. The feature must be
enabled and configured on the router, enabled on
the network adapters, and configured in Windows
for every computer on the network that uses the
high-priority applications. In the Core 2 module
“Network Security and Troubleshooting,” you
learn how to configure a router to use QoS. To
enable QoS on a Windows computer’s NIC, open
the network adapter Properties dialog box in
Device Manager. On the Advanced tab, make sure
Priority Enabled or Priority & VLAN Enabled is
selected, as shown in Figure 7-26. If the option is
not listed, the adapter does not support QoS.

Figure 7-27 A star bus network is formed by nodes connected to multiple switches
Switches and Hubs
Core 1 Objective 2.2
Today’s Ethernet networks use a design called a star bus topology, which means that nodes are connected to one or
more centralized devices, which are connected to each other (see Figure 7-27). The three centralized devices shown
in the figure are called switches.
Here are the differences between a hub and a switch:
●● An Ethernet hub sends a message to every device except the device that sent the message, as shown in
Figure 7-28A. A hub is just a passthrough and distribution point for every device connected to it, without
regard for what kind of data is passing through and where the data might be going. Hubs are outdated
technology, having been replaced by switches. Figure 7-29 shows a hub that supports 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps
Ethernet speeds. (You can’t find hubs these days to support faster networks.)

●● A switch (see Figure 7-30) is smarter and more efficient than a hub because it keeps a table of all the MAC
addresses for devices connected to it. When the switch receives a message, it searches its MAC address
table for the destination MAC address of the message and sends the message only to the interface for the
device using this MAC address (see Figure 7-28B). At first, a switch does not know the MAC addresses of
every device connected to it. It learns this information as it receives messages and records each source MAC
address in its MAC address table. When it receives a message destined to a MAC address not in its table,
the switch acts like a hub and sends the message to all devices except the one that sent it. In the module
“Network Infrastructure and Cloud Computing,” you learn more about how switches manage network traffic.

Core 1 Objective 2.2
To connect to the Internet, a device or a network first connects to an Internet service provider (ISP), such as
Xfinity or Spectrum. The most common types of connections for SOHO networks are cable, fiber optic, and DSL.
See Figure 7-31.

A device is needed to convert cable, DSL, or fiber optic transmissions to Ethernet transmissions used on a local network. For
cable, this device is called a cable modem (see Figure 7-32). DSL
uses a DSL modem, and fiber optic uses an optical network terminal (ONT). Cable modems and DSL modems usually sit beside
the SOHO router inside an office or data closet. An ONT is usually mounted on the outside of the building where fiber optic
cable terminates, and the ONT connects to an Ethernet cable
that enters the building. Regardless of the transmission technology or converting device used, each provides an RJ-45 Ethernet
port for a SOHO router or computer to connect to. Looking back
at Figure 7-31, note that the LAN begins with the router, which
is also considered part of the ISP network. (A router stands
between and is part of two or more networks.) The ISP is normally responsible only for its system up to and including the
modem or ONT.
To set up a modem, plug in the TV coax cable and the Ethernet cable, and turn on the modem. Notice in Figure 7-32, the red
Reset button, which you can use to reset a modem to its factory
default settings. When troubleshooting a modem, try rebooting
it first, and only use the reset button as a last resort.
Multifunction SOHO Router
Core 1 Objective 2.2
Routers can range from small ones designed to manage a SOHO network that connects to an ISP (costing around $50
to $300) to those that manage multiple networks and extensive traffic (costing several thousand dollars). On a small
office or home network, a router stands between the ISP network and the local network (refer back to Figure 7-31),
and the router is the local network’s gateway to the Internet.

An example of a multifunction router is
the Nighthawk AC1900 by NETGEAR, shown in
Figures 7-33 and 7-34. It has one Internet port (also
called the WAN or wide-area-network port) to connect to the ISP by way of a modem or ONT and four
ports for devices on the network. The USB port can
be used to plug in a USB external hard drive for file
sharing on the network. The router is also a wireless access point with multiple antennas to increase
speed and range.
Computer, printers, smartphones and other
devices can connect to this router using wired or
wireless connections. This is because a SOHO router
often serves different functions in a single device.
A typical SOHO router usually combines these
functions:
●● As a router, it stands between two
networks—the ISP network and the local
network—and routes traffic between the
two networks.
●● As a switch, it manages several network
ports that can be connected to wired
devices on the local network or to a dedicated switch that provides even more ports
for locally networked computers. Looking
back at Figure 7-31, one LAN port connects
to a switch, and another LAN port connects
to a desktop computer.
●● As a DHCP server, it can provide IP
addresses to computers and other devices
on the local network.
●● As a wireless access point (WAP), it enables
wireless devices to connect to the network.
These wireless connections can be secured
using wireless security features, which you
learn about in the Core 2 module “Network
Security and Troubleshooting.”
●● As a firewall, it blocks unwanted traffic from the Internet and can restrict Internet access for local devices
behind the firewall. Restrictions on local devices can apply to days of the week, time of day, keywords used,
certain websites, and specific applications.
●● If an external storage device, such as a USB flash drive or external hard drive, connects to the router via the
USB port, the router can be used to share files with network users.

Local Network Setup and Configuration
Core 1 Objectives 2.5, 2.6
Suppose you are called on to help a small bookkeeping company with three employees set up its network in a single
office space. You have purchased a SOHO router, switch, several patch cables, three laptops, a desktop computer,
and network printer. The local telecommunications company has already installed the fiber optic cable to the office
along with Ethernet cabling from the ONT unit outside the building to a wall jack in the office. Let’s step through the
process of setting up and configuring the local network.
The process of building and maintaining a large, corporate network is outside the scope of this text. However, working
with smaller networks, such as those used in homes and small businesses, helps prepare you to work in larger network
environments.
Note 8
We begin our setup with configuring the router.
Installing and Configuring a SOHO Router
Core 1 Objectives 2.5, 2.6
For routers that have external antennas, raise the antennas to vertical positions. Connect the network cable from
the ISP modem or other device or wall jack to the WAN port on the router. Plug in and turn on the router. Indicator
lights should indicate network activity on the WAN.
To configure a router for the first time, always follow the directions of the manufacturer. For most SOHO routers,
you have some options:
●● For wireless connections. Download the router manufacturer’s app to your smartphone or laptop. Then to
connect to the router’s wireless network, for a smartphone, open the Settings app, go the Wi-Fi setup and
select the name of the router’s wireless network, which is called the Service Set Identifier (SSID). It should
be printed on the bottom of the router. Open the router app, which should step you through the router
setup.
●● For wired connections. Use a network cable to connect a laptop or desktop computer to a LAN port on the
router. Open a browser window. The browser should automatically connect to the webpage of the router
(see Figure 7-35). If it does not connect, look in the router documentation for the URL of the router’s webpage
(for example, router.asus.com) or the IP address of the router (for example, 192.168.1.1.).
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 and 1 Core 2 exams may require you to evaluate the needs of a business or residence in a given scenario
and to install, configure, and secure a SOHO wired and wireless router based on those needs. You learn more about
configuring routers in the Core 2 module “Network Security and Troubleshooting,” including how to secure the local
wired and wireless network using features on the router.
Now that you know about TCP/IP, Windows networking and networking hardware, let’s see how to set up and
configure a new network from scratch.

Regardless of how you connect to the router, the initial setup should:
●● Provide a username and password if needed to connect to your ISP
●● Assign a new SSID and password (security key) to the wireless network
●● Update the router firmware
●● Change the password for the router firmware
●● Configure the DHCP server embedded in the router firmware
Figure 7-35 Starting page for the router’s quick Internet setup routine
There’s more you can do to configure a router to secure a local wired or wireless network, which you learn about in the
Core 2 module “Network Security and Troubleshooting.”
Core to Core
The setup screens for each router might be different. For the ASUS RT-AX55, on the router home page shown in
Figure 7-35, click Create A New Network. On the screens that follow, you are given the chance to enter the optional
username and password to the ISP, assign a new SSID and password to the wireless network (see Figure 7-36), update
the router firmware, and assign a username and password to sign in to the router firmware (see Figure 7-37).
Caution
Changing the router firmware login name and password is especially important if the router is a wireless router. Unless
you have disabled or secured the wireless network, anyone within its range—even outside your building—can use
your wireless network. If someone guesses the default login in name and password to the router, they can change the
password to hijack your router and access your wireless network, potentially using it for criminal activity.

Configure the DHCP Server
A DHCP server on a SOHO router is usually configured for dynamic IP addressing by default. To verify and change
the DHCP settings, do the following:
1. Go to the router firmware home page (router.asus.com, for example) and sign in with your router account
username and password that you set up earlier. The main menu for the router appears. Figure 7-38
shows the main menu for the ASUS RT-AX55, but yours might look different. To configure the DHCP
server, click LAN in the left pane. The LAN submenu tabs appear.

3. By default, DHCP is enabled and the scope of IP addresses that DHCP can lease to DHCP client devices is
192.168.1.2 through 192.168.1.254. Because the default gateway does not have a value, it is assumed the
router itself is the gateway. After making changes on this page, click Apply to save your changes.

Scope of IP
addresses
As you advance in your networking skills, you’ll learn how to choose subnet masks and ranges of IP addresses to divide
a large network into more manageable subnets. For now, know that if your range of IP addresses varies only in the last
octet, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. If the range of IP addresses varies in the last two octets, the subnet mask is
255.255.0.0. You’ll learn more about subnets in the module “Network Infrastructure and Cloud Computing.”
Note 9
Reserve IP Addresses
A network device such as a printer needs a consistent IP address at all times, so computers that access the printer
don’t need to be told its new IP address each time it reconnects to the network. In addition, a computer that is running a service, such as a web server, needs a consistent IP address so other computers can consistently find the
web server. You could assign the printer and web server IP addresses by configuring the device or computer for
static IP addressing. Alternately, you can assign the same IP address to a device or computer by creating an address

reservation on the DHCP server so the DHCP client receives or leases the same IP address each time it connects to
the network. Do the following to reserve an IP address:
1. To identify the computer or printer, you’ll need its MAC address. When the client is connected to the
network, the router can report its MAC address. Look for a Network Map page. If the router doesn’t
report the MAC address, look for a label near the network port of the printer or in its documentation.
2. To assign a reserved IP address to the client, go to the LAN-DHCP Server page shown earlier in
Figure 7-39. For Enable Manual Assignment, select Yes. Enter the MAC address and reserved IP address
for the client (see Figure 7-40). Be sure to use an IP address in the range of IP addresses assigned by
the DHCP server. Click the 1 sign to the left of the entries, and then click Apply. In Figure 7-40, a Canon
network printer is set to receive the IP address 192.168.1.100 each time it connects to the network.
It’s helpful to network users to write this IP address on a label taped in plain sight on the printer or
web server.

Connecting a Computer to a Local Network
Core 1 Objectives 2.5, 2.6
Connecting a laptop or desktop computer to a network is quick and easy in most situations. To connect a computer
to a network using an Ethernet wired or Wi-Fi wireless connection, follow these steps:
1. In general, before you connect to any network, the network adapter and its drivers must be installed,
and Device Manager should report no errors.
2. Do one of the following to connect to the network:
●● For a wired network, plug in the network cable to a wall jack or switch, or directly to a SOHO router. Plug
the other end into the computer’s Ethernet port. Indicator lights near the network port should light up to
indicate connectivity and activity. For Ethernet, Windows should automatically configure the connection.
●● For a wireless network, click the Network icon in the taskbar on the desktop, and select a wireless
network. Click Connect. If the network is secured, you must enter the security key to the wireless
network to connect.
3. If this is the first time you’ve connected to a local network, you’ll be asked if you want to make the PC
discoverable. For private networks (such as your home or business), click Yes, and for public networks
(such as a coffee shop hotspot), click No.
For a private corporate or enterprise network, Windows Server or Microsoft Azure is likely used to manage access to
the network using a Windows domain. You must sign in to the Windows domain with a user name and password. Press
Ctrl1Alt1Del to access the sign-on screen. The username might be text such as Jane Smith or an email address such
as JSmith@mycompany.com. You learn more about private networks, public networks, and Windows domains in the
Core 2 module “The Complex World of IT Professionals.”
Note 10
4. Open your browser and make sure you can access the web. For wireless connections, some hotspots
provide an initial page called a captive portal, where you must enter a code or agree to the terms of use
before you can use the network. On a private network, open Explorer and drill down into the Network
group to verify that network resources are available (see Figure 7-41).
Figure 7-41 File Explorer shows resources on the network
To view and change network security settings, in the Settings app, click Network & Internet. In the Status
window (see Figure 7-42A), under Network status, click Properties. Under Network profile, select either Public or
Private. See Figure 7-42B.

If you have a problem making a network connection, you can reset the connection. Open the Network
Connections window and right-click the network connection. Select Disable from the shortcut menu, as shown earlier in Figure 7-12. Right-click the connection again, and select Enable. The connection is reset. Try again to browse
the web or access resources on the network. If you still don’t have local or Internet access, it’s time to dig a little
deeper into the source of the problem. More network troubleshooting tools and solutions are covered in the module
“Network Security and Troubleshooting.”
Now let’s turn our attention to how to configure settings for a network connection, including dynamic, static,
and alternate address configurations.
Configure TCP/IP Settings
Core 1 Objectives 2.5, 2.6
Most networks use dynamic IP addressing. By default, Windows requests dynamic IP configuration from the DHCP
server, and there is nothing for you to configure. (As you know, the DHCP server might serve up a dynamic or
reserved IP address to a client.) In some situations, however, the network does not have a DHCP server, so as an IT
support technician, you need to know how to configure static IP addressing.
Figure 7-44 View the network security key for the wireless network
2. In the Network Connections window, right-click the Wi-Fi connection (refer back to Figure 7-12), and
click Status. In the Wi-Fi Status dialog box (see Figure 7-44), click Wireless Properties. In the Wireless
Network Properties dialog box, select the Security tab. To view the security key, check Show characters.
You can also see the security and encryption types that Windows automatically detected and applied
when it made the connection.

Figure 7-45 Configure TCP/IPv4 for static IP addressing
Follow these steps to configure static IP addressing:
1. Open the Network Connections window. Right-click the network connection, and click Properties. In the
Properties dialog box on the Networking tab (as shown in the middle box of Figure 7-45), select Internet
Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and click Properties. The TCP/IPv4 Properties dialog box appears (see
the right side of Figure 7-45).
2. As you saw in Figure 7-13, the default is dynamic IP addressing, which uses the Obtain an IP address
automatically and Obtain DNS server address automatically settings. In Figure 7-45, static IP addressing is
used. To change the settings to static IP addressing, select Use the following IP address. Then enter the
IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.
As an IT support technician, it’s unlikely you’ll ever be called on to configure static IPv6 addressing. However, to do so,
use the Properties dialog box shown in the middle of Figure 7-45. Select Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6), and
click Properties.
You can also uncheck Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) to disable it. For most situations, you need to leave
it enabled.
Note 11
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to configure dynamic, reserved, and static IP addresses on a router or
computer. You also need to recognize whether an IP address is an automatic private IP address.
3. If your network administrator has given you the IP addresses of DNS servers, select Use the following
DNS server addresses, and enter up to two IP addresses. If you have additional DNS IP addresses, click
Advanced and enter them on the DNS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Settings box.

Alternate IP Address Configuration
Core 1 Objective 2.5
Suppose an employee with a laptop often travels, and
the work network uses static IP addressing, even though
most public networks use dynamic IP addressing. How
do you configure the employee’s computer’s network
connection settings? For travel, you would configure
the computer to use dynamic IP addressing in order to
connect to public networks. However, using that configuration means that when the computer attempts to connect to the corporate network, it won’t be able to find a
DHCP server. Recall that, in this situation, the computer
generates an Automatic private IP address (APIPA) in
the address range 169.254.x.y. However, you can assign
a static IP address by using an alternate configuration.
To create an alternate configuration, first use the
General tab of the TCP/IPv4 Properties dialog box
shown earlier in Figure 7-13 to set the configuration
for dynamic IP addressing. Then click the Alternate
Configuration tab. See Figure 7-46. Select User
configured. Then enter a static IP address, subnet
mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses for
the alternate configuration to be used on the company
network. Click OK and close all dialog boxes. Now the
computer will first attempt to gather network connection settings from a DHCP server. If a DHCP server is not
available on the network, the computer will instead use
the static IP settings you just entered.
Next, let’s learn a little about configuring DNS, which might also be expected of IT technicians when configuring
networks.
DNS Configuration Basics
Core 1 Objective 2.6
Suppose your company decides to publish a website or run its own email server. In this situation, you might be called
on to make entries in the DNS namespace so that the world will know how to reach your website or email server. The
DNS namespace is the entire collection of DNS databases stored on DNS servers (also called name servers) around
the globe. In these databases, an individual entry, such as one that associates a host name with a given IP address,
is called a resource record (RR). Resource records are collected into zone files. Often, one zone file holds all the
records for a single domain, such as cengage.com. Each resource record can have up to six parts:
●● Name of the resource (host name)
●● Record type
●● Class code (always IN, which means the record is allowed on the Internet)
●● TTL (time-to-live)—the time a server can hold the record in its cache; the default is one hour
●● Length of data
●● Data

There are about 30 types of DNS records. Here are the most common types of records you might be called on
to edit:
●● A record. An A record (address record) points a host name to its IP address. A website requires an A record
such as this one:
www.mycompany.com A IN 14400 89.210.18.45
Explanation:
■ The resource name is the host www.mycompany.com.
■ The record type is A.
■ The class is IN.
■ TTL is 14,400 seconds.
■ Data is the IP address mapped to the host.
●● AAAA record. A AAAA record (pronounced “quad-A record”) is an address record for IPv6 addresses. Here
is an example:
www.mycompany.com AAAA IN 2001:07b8:8ba3:0000:0000:6a22:0323:7223
●● CNAME record. A CNAME (Canonical Name) record redirects from one host name to another, for example:
www.mycompany.com CNAME IN newcompany.com
●● MX record. The MX (Mail Exchanger) record points an email server domain name to an IP address:
email.mycompany.com MX IN 95.165.13.45
●● TXT record. A TXT (Text) record is a general-purpose record used to insert text into the DNS namespace.
One clever way TXT records are used is when a company, such as PayPal, sends TXT records to an email
provider, such as Yahoo!, to alert the email provider of potential fraudulent email, thereby preventing spoofing (email pretending to be from PayPal). Here are three ways TXT records are used for this purpose:
■ DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) records authenticate that an email message came from a trusted
source by attaching a domain name identifier to the message. For more info, see dkim.org.
■ SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records combat email spoofing by informing a recipient’s mail server
which email servers can send email from your domain.
■ DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) records tell a
recipient’s mail server what to do when it receives a fraudulent email message and is designed to work
with DKIM and SPF. Figure 7-47 shows how the process works. For more info, see dmarc.org/overview.

Viewing and Clearing the DNS Cache
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 2.6
When Windows is trying to resolve a computer name to an IP address, it first looks in the DNS cache it holds in
memory. If the computer name is not found in the cache, Windows then turns to a DNS server if it has the IP address
of the server.
Suppose a user is unable to reach a website on their computer but you can access it from your help desk
computer. One good step to use when troubleshooting name resolution problems is to clear the DNS cache. Open
a command prompt window, and run the ipconfig /displaydns command to view the DNS cache on your
computer. Then run the ipconfig /flushdns command to clear the DNS cache. Windows will rebuild its cache
by collecting up-to-date DNS information from the DNS servers you’ve configured Windows to use.
Applying Concepts
A telltale sign that the network’s DNS server is malfunctioning is when you can reach a website by its IP address,
but not by its FQDN.
Note 12
Module Summary
Understanding TCP/IP and Windows Networking
●● In networking, an application is identified by a port address. A device on the network—and its network
connection—are identified by an IP address. A network adapter is identified by a MAC address.
●● A computer can be assigned a computer name, and a network can be assigned a domain name. A fully
qualified domain name (FQDN) includes the computer name and the domain name. An FQDN can be used
to find a computer on the Internet if this name is associated with an IP address kept by DNS servers in the
DNS namespace.
●● According to the TCP/IP model, networking communication must happen at four layers: Link, Internet,
Transport, and Application.
●● The Internet primarily uses client/server applications for communication. Common server applications
include a web server, mail server, file server, print server, DHCP server, DNS server, proxy server, AAA server,
syslog server, FTP server, Telnet server, SSH server, RDP server, and SNMP server.
●● TCP/IP uses several protocols at the Application layer (such as FTP, HTTP, and Telnet) and at the Transport
layer (such as TCP and UDP). The Internet layer primarily relies on IP, and the Link layer mostly uses
Ethernet and Wi-Fi protocols.
●● At the Transport layer, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, and UDP is a connectionless protocol.
●● At the Internet layer, the OS identifies a network connection by an IP address. At the Transport layer, a port
address identifies an application.
●● At the Link layer, a network adapter has a MAC address that uniquely identifies it on the network.
●● IP addresses can be dynamic or static. A dynamic IP address is assigned by a DHCP server when the computer first connects to a network. A static IP address is manually assigned.

●● A host needs an IP address, a subnet mask, a default gateway, and IP addresses for DNS servers to communicate with other hosts on the local or remote networks.
●● An IPv4 address has 32 bits, and an IPv6 address has 128 bits. Some IP addresses are private and can only
be used on a local network.
●● Using IPv4, the string of 1s in a subnet mask determines the number of leftmost bits in an IP address that
identify the local network. The string of 0s determines the number of rightmost bits in the IP address that
identify the host.
●● Using IPv6, three types of IP addresses are a multicast address (used for one-to-many transmissions),
anycast address (used by routers), and unicast address (used to address a single node on a network).
Network Hardware
●● Network adapters, commonly called NICs, are rated by speed, and each has a MAC address. Some NICs have
status indicator lights and wake-on-LAN and QoS features.
●● A hub is an outdated networking distribution device that broadcasts messages. A switch is more efficient
because it works to send a message only to the device to which the message is addressed.
●● A cable modem stands between an ISP and a local network to convert signals from each network so the
other network can understand it.
●● A multifunction router for a small office/home office network might serve several functions, including router,
switch, DHCP server, wireless access point, firewall, and FTP server.
Local Network Setup and Configuration
●● It’s extremely important to change the administrative password on a router as soon as you install it, especially if the router also serves as a wireless access point.
●● A DHCP server is configured to lease a scope or range of IP addresses to DHCP clients on the network and
can reserve certain IP addresses to be used as static IP addresses on the network.
●● When connecting a computer to the local network, static or dynamic IP addressing can be used, and the
computer recognizes the network as a public or private network.
●● Four common types of DNS records include address records (A and AAAA), CNAME, MX records, and TXT
records.

Thinking Critically
These questions are designed to prepare you for the critical thinking required for the A1 exams and may use
information from other modules and the web.
1. You just finished installing a network adapter, and after booting up the system, you installed the drivers.
You open Explorer on a remote computer and don’t see the computer on which you installed the new NIC.
What is the first thing you check? What is the second thing?
a. Has IPv6 addressing been enabled?
b. Can the computer on which you installed the NIC access the network?
c. Do the lights on the adapter indicate it’s functioning correctly?
d. Has the computer been assigned a computer name?
2. Your manager has asked you to configure a DHCP reservation on the network for a Windows computer that
is used to configure other devices on a network. To do this, you need the computer’s MAC address. What
command can you enter at the command line to access this information?
3. The DHCP server in a SOHO router is using the IP scope of 192.168.50.2 to 192.168.50.254. The subnet mask
is 255.255.255.0. The technician has configured one computer with the static IP address of 192.168.1.100
and subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This computer cannot communicate with other computers on the local
network. What is the problem and a workable solution?
a. The computer is not in the same subnet as others on the network. Change the static IP address to
192.168.100.1.
b. The subnet mask on the router is not correct. Change it to 255.255.255.255.
c. The computer is not in the same subnet as others on the network. Change the static IP address to

Real Problems, Real Solutions
Setting Up a Small Network
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 2.5
The simplest possible wired network is two computers connected together using a crossover cable. In a crossover
cable, the send and receive wires are crossed so one computer can send and the other computer can receive on the
same wire. At first glance, a crossover cable looks just like a regular network cable (also called a patch cable) except
for the labeling, as shown in Figure 7-48. (In the module “Network Infrastructure and Cloud Computing,” you learn
how to distinguish between the cables by examining their connectors.)
Do the following to set up and test a small network:
1. Connect two computers using a crossover cable. Using the Network and Sharing Center, verify that
your network is up. Using ipconfig, determine each computer’s IP address. What is the IPv4 address of
Computer A? Of Computer B?
2. On each computer, open a command prompt window and use the ping command to test for connectivity.
For example, to test connectivity to the computer with IP address 10.20.30.1, enter the ping
10.20.30.1 command. Does it work? Why or why not? What specific output do you get?

3. Convert the TCP/IP configuration to static IP addressing. Assign 192.168.10.4 to one computer and
192.168.10.5 to the other computer. The subnet mask for both computers is 255.255.255.0.
4. Ping each computer from the other computer. Does it work? Why or why not?
5. Without changing the subnet masks, change the IP address of one computer to 192.168.90.1. Can you still
ping each computer? What specific output do you get?
6. Return the computers to the same subnet and IP addresses you used in step 3. Verify that each computer
can ping the other.
Installing and Using Packet Tracer
Est. Time: 1 hour
Core 1 Objective: 2.5
If you plan to pursue networking or security as your area of specialty in IT, you might consider earning a few Cisco
networking certifications after you complete your CompTIA A1, Network1, and Security1 certifications. The Cisco
Networking Academy website provides many useful tools for advancing your networking education. One of those
tools is a network simulator called Packet Tracer. In this project, you download and install Packet Tracer and create
a very basic network using simulated devices in Packet Tracer. This version of Packet Tracer is free to the public, and
your school does not have to be a member of Cisco’s Networking Academy for you to download and use it.
To get the Packet Tracer download, you must first sign up for the free Introduction to Packet Tracer online course
on the Cisco Networking Academy website. Complete the following steps to create your account:
1. In your browser, navigate to netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer. Enroll in the Introduction to Packet
Tracer course.
2. Open the confirmation email, and confirm your email address. Configure your account and save this
information in a safe place. You will need this information again.
3. Click Courses and select Packet Tracer.
Now you are ready to download and install Packet Tracer. If you need help with the download and installation
process, launch the course and navigate to Chapter 1, Section 1.1, Topic 1.1.2 for additional guidance. Complete
the following steps:
1. Inside the course, click Student Support and Resources, and then click Download and install the latest
version of Packet Tracer. Download the latest version for your computer, and then install Packet Tracer.
When the installation is complete, run Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. When Packet Tracer opens, sign in with your Networking Academy account that you created earlier. If you
see a Windows Security Alert, allow access through your firewall. Cisco Packet Tracer opens. The interface
window is shown in Figure 7-49.
The Introduction to Packet Tracer course presents an excellent introduction to Packet Tracer and provides
lab activities. We’ll revisit the Packet Tracer course in later modules. In the meantime, let’s build a very
simple network in Packet Tracer so you can begin to get familiar with the user interface.

3. First, you need a router. In Packet Tracer (and in most network diagrams), routers look like a hockey puck
with four arrows on top. In the Devices pane, make sure the Network Devices group is selected and the
Routers subgroup is selected. Drag a 2901 router from the selection pane into the workspace.
4. Next, add a switch. In network diagrams, switches look like rectangular boxes with four arrows on top. Click
to select the Switches subgroup, then drag a 2960-24TT switch to the workspace.
5. Now you’re ready to add a couple of computers. Select the End Devices group. Drag a PC and Laptop to the
workspace. Arrange all the devices as shown in Figure 7-50.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
6. Now you’re ready to connect the devices with Ethernet cables. Click the orange lightning icon to select
the Connections group. Use the lightning icon from the selection pane to automatically select the correct
connection type for each connection you make. (In the module “Network Infrastructure and Cloud
Computing,” you’ll learn more about different types of cables so you can make those decisions yourself.)
After you click the Automatically Choose Connection Type lightning icon, click PC0 to start the connection,
then click Switch0 to complete the connection. The link starts as orange, and as the connection is
negotiated between the PC and the switch, the link turns to green on both ends.
7. Create an automatic connection from Laptop0 to Switch0 and another automatic connection from Switch0
to Router0. The laptop-to-switch connection will come up automatically. The switch-to-router connection
will remain red because it requires additional configuration before it will work.
8. Click Router0 to see its configuration window. On the Physical tab, you can see a picture of the device itself,
both front and back. Explore this window to see what information is available to you, but don’t change
anything. When you’re ready, click the Config tab.
In Packet Tracer, you can perform all the configurations at the CLI (command line interface) or through
a GUI (graphic user interface). In this project, you’ll use the GUI options, and watch the Equivalent IOS
Commands pane at the bottom of the window to see what commands you’re executing.
9. To activate the router’s interface, click the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface in the left pane. Position the
configuration window off to the side of the workspace so you can see Router0 and monitor any changes to
the connection. Change the Port Status to On. What happens to the connection in the workspace?
10. Let’s add IP configuration information. Give the connection the IP Address of 192.168.43.1 and a Subnet
Mask of 255.255.255.0. Then close Router0’s configuration window.
11. Next, add IP address configuration information to the endpoint devices. Click PC0 to open its configuration
window. Here, you could use the Config tab or tools from the Desktop tab. Click Desktop, and then click IP
Configuration. You have two options: DHCP or Static. For now, you’ll have to use Static. Why?
12. Make sure Static is selected, then give the PC the following IP configuration:
●● IP Address: 192.168.43.100
●● Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
●● Default Gateway: 192.168.43.1
With this configuration, what device will the PC use as its default gateway?
13. Close PC0’s configuration window, then use the same steps to give Laptop0 the following IP configuration:
●● IP Address: 192.168.43.200
●● Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
●● Default Gateway: 192.168.43.1
14. On Laptop0, close the IP Configuration pane. On the Desktop tab, click Command Prompt. Ping PC0 from
Laptop0. What command did you use? Did it work?
15. You can use Simulation mode to watch the ping messages travel over the network. Close Laptop0’s
configuration window, then click the Simulation button in the bottom right of the Packet Tracer window
(refer back to Figure 7-49). Open Laptop0’s Command Prompt window again, and position this window
off to the side of the workspace so you can see the devices. Ping the router. What command did you use?
Repeatedly tap the play button in the Simulation Panel to see each step in the process. (See Figure 7-51.)
Did it work?
16. This network is not connected to a simulated WAN connection, although it could be. Which device in this
network would you connect to the modem for the ISP’s network?

Introduction
You’ve already learned how to connect a computer to a network and how to set up a wired and wireless router for a
small network. This module takes you a step further in supporting networks. You learn about the hardware devices,
cables, and connectors used to construct a network. Next, you learn about various specialized network systems and
how networking tools are used to terminate network cables. You also learn how to troubleshoot problems with network
hardware and software. Finally, after our exploration of network infrastructure, you are introduced to virtualization
and cloud computing. Let’s start by discussing the different types of networks you may be asked to set up or manage.
Types of Networks and Network Connections
Core 1 Objective 2.7
A computer network is created when two or more computers can communicate with each other. Networks can be
categorized by several methods, including the technology used and the size of the network. When networks are  categorized by their size, or the physical area they cover, these are the categories used, listed from smallest to largest:
● PAN. A PAN (personal area network) consists of personal devices such as cell phones and laptop computers communicating at close range. PANs can use wired connections (such as USB or Lightning) or wireless
connections (such as Bluetooth or near-field communications).
● LAN. A LAN (local area network) covers a small local area, such as a home, office, or a small group of buildings. LANs can use wired (most likely Ethernet) or wireless technologies (most likely Wi-Fi). A LAN allows
workstations, servers, printers, and other devices to communicate and share resources.
● SAN. A SAN (storage area network) is a specialized, high-speed network for storing and sharing files. These storage locations can be accessed by network clients, as if they were directly connected to the local client machine.
● WLAN. A WLAN (wireless local area network) is a wireless-capable network that covers a small local area,
just like a LAN.
● MAN. A MAN (metropolitan area network) covers multiple buildings in a large campus or a portion of
a city, such as a downtown area. It’s usually the result of a cooperative effort to improve service to its
users. Network technologies used can be wireless (most likely LTE) and/or wired (for example, Ethernet
with fiber-optic cabling).
● WAN. A WAN (wide area network) covers a large geographical area and is made up of many smaller
networks. The best-known WAN is the Internet, or the World Wide Web. Some technologies that connect
a single computer or LAN to the Internet include DSL, cable Internet, satellite, cellular WAN, and fiber optic.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to compare PAN, LAN, SAN, WLAN, MAN, and WAN networks.
Now let’s look at network technologies used for Internet connections.
Internet Connection Technologies
Core 1 Objectives 2.2, 2.3, 2.7
To connect to the Internet, a device or network first connects to an Internet service provider (ISP), such as Verizon
or Spectrum. The common types of connections for SOHO networks are DSL and cable Internet. See Figure 8-1. When
connecting to an ISP, know that upload speeds are generally slower than download speeds. These rates differ because
users typically download more data than they upload. Therefore, an ISP devotes more of the available bandwidth
to downloading and less of it to uploading.

Networks are built using one or more technologies that provide varying degrees of bandwidth. Bandwidth is
the theoretical maximum number of bits that can be transmitted over a network connection at one time, similar
to the number of lanes on a highway. The networking industry refers to bandwidth as a measure of the maximum
rate of data transmission in bits per second (bps), thousands of bits per second (Kbps), millions of bits per second
(Mbps), or billions of bits per second (Gbps). Bandwidth is the theoretical or potential speed of a network, whereas
data throughput is the average of the actual speed. In practice, network transmissions experience delays, called
latency, that result in slower network performance. For example, wired signals traveling across long cables or
wireless signals crossing long distances through the air can cause signal strength degradation, resulting in latency.
Latency is measured by the round-trip time (RTT) it takes for a message to travel from source to destination and
back to source.
Table 8-1 lists network technologies used by local networks to connect to the Internet. The table is more or less
ordered from slowest to fastest maximum bandwidth within each category, although latency can affect the actual
bandwidth of any network. We explore many of these technologies in more depth throughout this module.

beyond
5G services are now widespread across many major metropolitan
areas; coverage will continue to increase as providers implement
more coverage antenna.

Cable Internet and DSL are two options to make an Internet connection for a home network. Let’s first quickly
compare these two technologies and then look at fiber-optic dedicated lines, satellite, cellular WAN, wireless Internet
service providers, and long-range fixed wireless connections that may be found in commercial applications.
Cable Internet
Cable Internet is a broadband technology that uses cable TV lines
and is always connected (always up). With cable Internet, the TV
signal to your television and the data signals to your computer
or LAN share the same coaxial (coax) cable, an older cable form
that is still used today in local area networks. The cable modem
converts the computer’s digital signals to analog when sending
them and converts incoming analog data to digital.
DSL Broadband
DSL (digital subscriber line) is a group of broadband technologies
that covers a wide range of speeds. DSL uses ordinary copper
phone lines and a range of frequencies on the copper wire that
are not used by voice, making it possible for you to use the same
phone line for voice and DSL at the same time. When you make a
regular phone call, you dial in as usual. However, the DSL part of
the line is always connected (always up) for most DSL services.
With DSL, static over phone lines in your house
can be a problem. The DSL company normally provides
filters to install at each phone jack (see Figure 8-2), but
the problem still might not be fully solved. Figure 8-3
shows a DSL modem that can connect directly to a
computer or to a router on your network.
Both cable and DSL connections typically require
a modem device at the entry to your SOHO network.
Although you might be able to find the modem’s default
login instructions online, you’ll likely never have to
change any settings on the modem itself. Configuring
a DSL or cable modem consists of plugging the correct
cables into the correct ports. For example, Figure 8-4
shows a cable modem with the ISP coax cable connected on the right. The yellow Ethernet cable connects to the local network, and a phone line is plugged
into the Voice-over-IP (VoIP) phone service provided
by the ISP over the Internet. Also notice the Reset button in the figure, which you can use to reset a modem
to its factory default settings. When troubleshooting a
modem, try rebooting it first, and only use the reset as
a last resort.

home, filters are needed on
every phone jack except the
one used by the DSL modem
Figure 8-3 This DSL modem connects to a phone
jack and a computer or router to provide

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to compare
these network types used for Internet connections: cable,
DSL, dial-up, fiber, satellite, ISDN, and cellular (tethering
and mobile hotspot).

Dedicated Line Using Fiber Optic
Another broadband technology used for Internet access is fiber optic. This technology connects a dedicated line
from your ISP to your place of business or residence. This dedicated line is called a point-to-point (PTP) connection
because no other business or residence shares the line with you. Television, Internet data, and voice communication
all share the broadband fiber-optic cable, which reaches all the way from the ISP to your home. This line then connects to an optical network terminal (ONT). The ONT serves as a modem for the fiber connection (see Figure 8-5).
Alternatively, the provider might install fiber-optic cabling up to your neighborhood and then run coaxial cable (like
that used in cable Internet connections) for the last leg of the connection to your business or residence. Upstream
and downstream speeds and prices vary.

Satellite
People who live in remote areas and want high-speed Internet connections often have limited choices. DSL and cable
options might not be available where they live, but satellite access is available from pretty much anywhere. Internet
access by satellite is available even on airplanes. Passengers can connect to the Internet using a wireless hotspot
and satellite dish on the plane. A satellite dish mounted on top of your house or office building communicates
with a satellite used by an ISP offering the satellite service (see Figure 8-6). One disadvantage of satellite is that it
requires line-of-sight wireless connectivity without obstruction from mountains, trees, and tall buildings. Another Wikimedia Commons

disadvantage is that it experiences higher delays in transmission (latency), especially when uploading, and is therefore not a good solution for an Internet connection that will
be used for videoconferencing or voice over Internet.
Cellular WAN
A cellular network, also called a cellular WAN because it
consists of cells, is provided by companies such as Verizon
and AT&T. Each cell is controlled by a base station (see
Figure 8-7), which might include more than one transceiver
and antenna on the same tower to support various technologies for both voice and data transmission.
Cellular devices require a SIM (subscriber identity
module) card to be installed in the device; the card contains
the information that identifies your device to the carrier
(see Figure 8-8).

Most smartphones are linked by the manufacturer to a specific cellular provider and will need to be validated
on that provider’s network to connect to it. To connect a computer using mobile broadband to a cellular network,
you need the hardware and software to connect and, for most networks, a SIM card. The bulleted list that follows
includes the options for software and hardware devices that can connect to a cellular network and general steps
for how to create each connection. Keep in mind that when you purchase any of these devices from a carrier or
manufacturer, detailed instructions are most likely included for connecting to the cellular network.
● Embedded mobile broadband modem. A laptop or other mobile device might have an embedded broadband modem. In this situation, you still need to subscribe to a carrier. If a SIM card is required, insert the
card in the device. For some laptops, the card slot might be in the battery bay, and you must remove the
battery to find the slot. Then use a setting or application installed on the device to connect to the cellular
network.
● Cell phone tethering. You can tether your computer or another device to your cell phone. The cell phone
connects to the cellular network and provides communication to the tethered device. To use your phone for
Figure 8-9 Tethering a laptop to a cell phone using a USB
cable

tethering, your carrier contract must allow
it. The phone and other device can connect
by way of a USB cable (see Figure  8-9), a
proprietary cable provided by your cell
phone manufacturer, or a Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi wireless connection. Your carrier
is likely to provide you software to make
the connection, or the setting might be
embedded in the phone’s OS.
● USB broadband modem. For any computer, you can use a USB broadband
modem (sometimes called an air card),
such as the one shown in Figure 8-10. The
device requires a contract with a cellular
carrier. If needed when using a USB broadband modem, insert the SIM card in the
modem (see Figure 8-11). When you insert
the modem into a USB port, Windows finds
the device, and the software stored on the
device automatically installs and runs.
A window provided by the software then
appears and allows you to connect to the
cellular network.

● LTE home Internet. Some cellular companies offer home Internet service through their cellular WAN
infrastructure. Verizon calls its service LTE Home Internet, and AT&T calls its service FWI (Fixed Wireless
Internet). The ISP installs an LTE router at the home, possibly with an external antenna, which then connects wirelessly to the ISP’s cellular network. The router provides a Wi-Fi hotspot as well as a few Ethernet
ports for wired devices. Typically, the router can’t be moved to other locations like a smartphone can—
it’s designed to be used only at the location where the subscription is established. Data usage caps also
may apply.
● Mobile hotspot. Some mobile devices can create a mobile hotspot, which allows computers and other
mobile devices to connect by Wi-Fi to the device and, through that connection, to the Internet. Some cellular
ISPs, such as AT&T, also offer devices dedicated to this purpose.
Wireless Internet Service Providers
A wireless Internet service provider (WISP) provides wireless network coverage to a certain location using wireless broadband. These
providers used to be found only in rural areas where conventional networking technologies such as cable or DSL were not available. Now,
however, they can be found in metropolitan areas as well. Consisting
of wireless transmitters and customer premise antennae, as shown in
Figure 8-12, these networks can expand Internet coverage across the
globe. Another example of a WISP was seen in the WiFi101 network
project that ran from 2008 to 2015 in East Palo Alto, California. As part
of that project, Google provided completely free wireless coverage to
the entire community.
Long-Range Fixed Wireless
Long-range fixed wireless (LRFW) networks are used to provide
low-cost, point-to-point connections. These networks are typically
unregulated and provide an alternative to either cellular or satellite
Internet access. These systems use highly directional antennas, which
transmit at high power, to transmit the wireless signal across large
distances, sometimes more than 100 miles. A LRFW antenna is shown
in Figure 8-13.

Currently, LRFW networks outside the United States use
unlicensed frequencies within the 2.4 and 5 GHz spectrum—like
your SOHO Wi-Fi—but require direct line of sight with the antenna.
Unlicensed means the frequency has not been assigned for this use
and is not regulated by any governing body.
In August 2011, the FCC began making room for licensed
frequencies for these systems to operate and also began regulating
regulate their use within the United States. By licensing the 7 and
13 GHz frequencies for point-to-point connections and setting limits
for how much power these networks can transmit with, the FCC is
setting the regulatory requirements to operate these networks, to
include the maximum power and frequencies. These parameters are
also intended to ensure that these networks do not interfere with
other communication networks.
Now that you understand some basics about the different types of
networks and methods of connecting those networks to the Internet,
you’re ready to learn about different devices used to connect computers to local networks.
Identifying Network
Hardware and
Infrastructure
Core 1 Objectives 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 3.1
In this section of the module, you learn about the hardware devices that create and connect to networks. We discuss
desktop and laptop devices, switches, bridges, and other network devices, along with the cables and connectors
these devices use.
Switches and Virtual LANs
Core 1 Objectives 2.2, 2.6
Recall that a switch is a device that connects other devices on a network. Two types of switches are managed
and unmanaged switches. An unmanaged switch requires no setup or configuration other than connecting network cables to its ports. It does not require
an IP address and is appropriate for SOHO
networks. A managed switch, seen in
Figure 8-14, has firmware that can be configured to monitor and manage network traffic. It’s appropriate for larger networks and
can be used to manage QoS for prioritizing
network traffic and to control speeds for
specific ports. The firmware on a managed
switch is accessed through a browser using
the switch’s IP address, which is similar to
how you access the firmware on a router. A
switch requires an IP address only for the
purpose of accessing its firmware to configure the switch.

You can also use a managed switch to break up a large LAN into smaller networks called virtual LANs (VLANs),
which can reduce network traffic. VLANs are created by assigning a group of physical ports on the switch to a different VLAN. In Figure 8-15, the one physical LAN is broken up into two virtual LANs. With network segmentation,
broadcast traffic is reduced because it is limited to each VLAN.

Internet
You can also break up a large network by subnetting, which involves using a DHCP server and assigning different
IP address ranges and subnet masks to each smaller network. Subnetting also helps reduce broadcast traffic on the
network and can optimize the network for faster service.
Here are reasons you might add switches to your network:
● To add network connections. A SOHO router usually has four to eight ports in a built-in switch. When you
need more connections, add a switch in a location where you have multiple workstations or printers that
need to connect to the network. In practice, a small network might begin as one switch and three or four computers. As the need for more computers grows, new switches are added to provide these extra connections.
● To regenerate the network signal. An Ethernet cable should not exceed 100 meters (about 328 feet) in
length. If you need to reach distances greater than that, you can add a switch in the line, which regenerates
the signal. An alternative to using a switch for this purpose would be to simply use a repeater device that
amplifies the signal onto the new extended cable run.
● To manage network traffic. Managed switches can be installed in strategic places on the network to subnet
the network and manage network traffic to improve performance.
Wireless Access Points
Core 1 Objectives 2.2, 2.3
You’ve already learned that a SOHO router can also be a wireless access point. In addition, a wireless access point
can be a dedicated device. The wireless access point can also serve as a bridge, as shown in Figure 8-16. A bridge is
a device that stands between two segments of a network and manages network traffic between them. For example,
one network segment might be a wireless network and the other segment might be a wired network; the wireless
access point (WAP) connects these two segments. Another use of a bridge can be found when a server is placed
between two networks, as in the case of a proxy server. The server would have two network interface cards to connect to each network segment.

Ethernet Standards and Cables
Ethernet can run at four speeds. Each version of Ethernet can use more than one cabling method. Here is a brief
description of the transmission speeds and the cabling methods they use:
● 100 Mbps Ethernet or Fast Ethernet. Fast Ethernet operates at 100 Mbps and typically uses copper cabling
rated CAT-5 or higher. Fast Ethernet networks can support slower speeds of 10 Mbps, used by the original
Ethernet standard, so devices that run at either 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps can coexist on the same LAN.
● 1000 Mbps Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet. This version of Ethernet operates at 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) and
uses twisted-pair cable and fiber-optic cable. Gigabit Ethernet is becoming the most popular choice for LAN
technology. Because it can use the same cabling and connectors as Fast Ethernet, a company can upgrade
from Fast Ethernet to Gigabit without rewiring the network.
● 10 Gbps Ethernet. This version of Ethernet operates at 10 billion bits per second (10 Gbps) and typically
uses fiber-optic cable. It can be used on LANs, MANs, and WANs and is also a good choice for network
backbones. (A network backbone is a channel whereby local networks can connect to wide area networks
or to each other.)
Twisted-Pair Cable
As you can see from Table 8-2, the two main types of cabling used by Ethernet are twisted-pair and fiber optic.
Twisted-pair cabling uses pairs of wires twisted together to reduce crosstalk, which is interference that degrades a
signal on the wire. It’s the most popular cabling method for local networks and uses an RJ-45 connector. The cable
comes in two varieties: unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable and shielded twisted-pair (STP) cable. UTP cable is
less expensive than STP and is commonly used on LANs. STP cable uses a covering or shield around each pair of
wires inside the cable that protects it from electromagnetic interference caused by electrical motors, transmitters,
or high-tension lines. Additional coatings can also shield the cable from the elements outside and allow the cable
to be buried in the ground. This is known as direct burial cable. STP cable costs more than unshielded cable, so
it’s used only when the situation demands it. Twisted-pair cable is rated by category (CAT), as listed in Table 8-3.
A rating indicates how well a cable can handle alien crosstalk (crosstalk between cables in a bundle) and near-end
crosstalk (NEXT), which is crosstalk between pairs of twisted wires within a cable where the wires terminate at the
end of the cable.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know the details listed in Table 8-2. Given a scenario, you need to recognize that
when a cable exceeds its recommended maximum length, limited connectivity problems can result.

At the time of this writing, CAT-7 and CAT-8 cables are starting to be used; however, the specifications have not been
fully approved by the TIA/EIA. These cables offer increased speeds at higher frequencies. CAT-7 is rated up to 10 Gbps
at 600 or 1000 MHz, and CAT-8 is rated up to 40 Gbps at 2 GHz. It should be noted that these cables are not for generic
wiring within a building and will only be used in data centers for short runs between equipment such as switches and
routers.

Normally, the plastic covering of a cable is made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), which is not safe when used inside the
plenum (airspaces between the floors of buildings). In these situations, plenum cable covered with Teflon is used
because it does not give off toxic fumes when burned. Plenum cable is two or three times more expensive than PVC
cable. Because they can look essentially the same, check for labels printed on the cable to determine whether it’s PVC
or plenum rated.
Note 2
Figure 8-17 shows unshielded twisted-pair cables. Twisted-pair cable has four pairs of twisted wires for a total
of eight wires. You learn more about how the eight wires are arranged later in this module.

Fiber Optic
Fiber-optic cables transmit signals as pulses of light
over glass or plastic strands inside protective tubing, as illustrated in Figure 8-18. Fiber-optic cable
comes in two types: single-mode (thin, difficult to
connect, expensive, and best performing) and multimode (most popular). A single-mode cable uses a
single path for light to travel through it and multimode cable uses multiple paths for light. Both single-mode and multimode fiber-optic cables can be
constructed as loose-tube cables for outdoor use
or tight-buffered cables for indoor or outdoor use.

Loose-tube cables are filled with gel to prevent water from soaking into the cable, and
tight-buffered cables are filled with synthetic
or glass yarn, called strength wires, to protect
the fiber-optic strands, as shown in Figure 8-18.
Fiber optic cables use a variety of connectors but the most common ones in networking
are the ST (straight tip) connector shown in
Figure 8-19, LC (Lucent connector) shown in
Figure 8-20, and the SC (subscriber connector)
shown in Figure 8-21. Depending on the hardware, the choice of connector should match
the port you are connecting the cable to.

Power over Ethernet (PoE)
Core 1 Objective 2.2
Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a feature that might be available on high-end PoE-rated switches to allow power
to be transmitted over Ethernet cable. There are two current PoE standards: PoE is specified in IEEE 802.3af, and
Power over Ethernet plus (PoE1) is under 802.3at. The main difference is the power levels provided. PoE has
a maximum of 15.4 watts, and PoE1 sends up to 25.5 watts through CAT-5 cabling to the device. Using this feature, you can place a wireless access point, webcam, IP phone, or other device that needs power in a position in
a building where you don’t have an electrical outlet. The Ethernet cable to the device provides both power and
data transmissions. If your switch doesn’t offer PoE, you can attach a PoE injector (see Figure 8-23), which adds
power to an Ethernet cable.
Coaxial
Coaxial cable, or coax, is a single conductor cable used to carry high-frequency electrical signals to customers. These
cables have been around for many years and have been used for cable television, telephone, and Internet services.
Coaxial cable was used for early implementations of Ethernet, but it is no longer used for that purpose. Today, the
most common uses are for cable modem connections between a customer and Internet service provider. Common
connectors using coaxial cable are the BNC and F-Type. BNC is normally found in industrial environments. Both are
shown in Figure 8-22.
Figure 8-22 Coaxial cable normally uses the BNC (left) or the F-type connector
(right)
Coaxial cable is categorized by its inner conductor diameter and outer jacket dimensions. RG-6 has widely
replaced older RG-59 cables to support television and cable Internet connections.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about the following cables and connectors: copper cables (coaxial cable with
an F-type connector, CAT-5, CAT-5e, CAT-6, CAT-6a, and Ethernet STP and UTP cables with the RJ-45 connector), fiberoptic cable with ST, SC, and LC connectors, plenum cables, and the RJ-11 connector.

Some devices, such as a webcam, are designed to receive both power and data from the Ethernet cable. For
other devices, you must use a splitter that splits the data and power transmissions before connecting to the non-PoE
device. Figure 8-24 shows a PoE switch, as well as a splitter used to provide power to a non-PoE access point. When
setting up a device to receive power by PoE, make sure the device sending the power, the splitter, and the device
receiving the power are all compatible. Pay special attention to the voltage and wattage requirements and the type
of power connector of the receiving device.

Internet of Things (IoT)
Core 1 Objective 2.4
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a term that is used to describe physical devices that are connected directly to a network and communicate directly to the Internet. Examples of IoT devices include cameras, doorbells, baby monitors,
health and fitness wearable technology, and even refrigerators and other appliances. A smart home network using
a variety of devices and wireless technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Zigbee) might look something like the
one shown in Figure 8-25. These devices are all directly or indirectly connected to the Internet and allow for remote
monitoring of your home or appliances from anywhere in the world.

IoT devices are normally centered around increasing quality of life and convenience; however, they do bring
questions of privacy and security because they can be accessed remotely. Imagine someone being able to connect
to your cameras or baby monitor from across the globe and spy on you. If you decide these devices should be a
part of your smart home, be sure to implement IoT security features that you learn about in the module “Network
Security and Troubleshooting.”
Devices and Software to Enhance Networking
Core 1 Objectives 2.4, 2.6
The best networks are those that make data, services, and other resources available to employees, customers, and
others in the most efficient and reliable way. In this section of the module, we explore infrastructure software and
hardware designed to improve network efficiency, reliability, monitoring, and security. Let’s begin with looking at
software designed to monitor and improve network performance.
Software-Defined Networking
Software-defined networking (SDN) uses software applications and programs to essentially virtualize networking. SDN applications replicate how a switch, router, or other networking hardware functions, all while constantly
monitoring the status of each device. An SDN architecture separates the movement of the data (referred to as the
data plane) from the hardware device (referred to as the control plane). By separating these two functions, an SDN
can make smarter decisions about the path data should take across the network, configuring priorities for certain
data or automating connections. This high-level view and the monitoring of the entire network are different from
traditional hardware networks because the network can be configured remotely in the SDN application without
having to configure individual networking devices.

SCADA Systems
Supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) systems are embedded computer
systems designed to monitor and control
machinery from a single location. For example, a manufacturing plant can use SCADA to
supervise an assembly line, or a nuclear power
plant can use SCADA to control power production. SCADA systems can be used in commercial buildings to monitor heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning (HVAC) and water supply
systems. Because these systems control and
operate important and critical systems, they
should be protected from regular network
access using a VLAN or dedicated subnet.
Remote access to these systems should also be
minimized or eliminated if possible. A SCADA
system control room is shown in Figure 8-26.
Unified Threat Management (UTM) Appliance
Recall that a router stands between the Internet and a private network to route traffic between the two networks.
It can also serve as a firewall to protect the network. A next-generation firewall (NGFW) combines basic firewall
functions with antivirus/anti-malware functions and perhaps other functions as well. NGFW components might
be installed on a dedicated appliance, router, server, or even in the cloud. In addition, an NGFW device can offer
comprehensive unified threat management (UTM) services. A UTM appliance, also called a security appliance,
stands between the Internet and a private network, as does a router, and it protects the network (see Figure 8-27).
Figure 8-28 shows a UTM appliance by FortiNet.

● Antivirus and anti-malware software. This software is usually much more advanced than what might be
installed on a server or workstation.
● Spam gateway. Spam gateways are used to control spam content and emails from entering a network. This
helps to reduce the amount of content being sent into the network.
● Identity-based access control lists. These lists control access of users or user groups and can log and report
activity of these users and groups to reveal misuse, data leaks, or unauthorized access to resources. The
company can use this feature to satisfy legal auditing requirements for detecting and controlling data leaks.
● Intrusion detection system. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors all network traffic and creates
alerts when suspicious activity happens. IDS software can run on a UTM appliance, router, server, or
workstation.
● Intrusion prevention system. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) not only monitors and logs suspicious
activity like the IDS, but it can also prevent the network traffic from entering the network, based on a set of
rules programmed into it.
● Endpoint management server. An endpoint management server provides monitoring of various endpoint
devices on the network, from computers and laptops to mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, or even
barcode readers. The service can ensure that endpoints are kept up to date with current anti-malware
requirements, operating system patches, and application updates. The system will restrict the device’s
access to the network until that device meets the security requirements, which gives an additional layer of
protection to other network resources.
● VPN. The appliance can provide a virtual private network (VPN) to remote users of the network, as shown
in Figure 8-27. This allows for secure remote access of your private network. You learn how to set up a VPN
in the Core 2 module “Networking Security and Troubleshooting.”
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to summarize the purposes of services provided by a UTM appliance,
including an IDS, IPS, endpoint management server, and VPN provider.
Load Balancer
A load balancer helps to ensure high-demand systems and applications are available when a user needs to
access them. By spreading the information or connection requests across multiple physical systems, the
load balancer ensures that no single system is overloaded. Among other uses, load balancers are sometimes
deployed on shopping and social media web servers. As illustrated in Figure 8-29, the devices on the left send

requests (marked by the numbers) that are spread across the two servers on the right. This ensures the two
servers do not get overloaded. Load balancers, sometimes called elastic load balancers, are used frequently
within cloud computing to spread the incoming requests across virtual servers in the cloud. The load balancer
can also create new copies of the virtual server as the demand increases or shut down these systems as the
demand decreases.
Configuring Network Infrastructure
Core 1 Objectives 2.2, 2.3, 2.8, 3.1
In the module “Networking Fundamentals,” you learned to configure a workstation and SOHO router to create a
small network and connect it to a device (for example, a DSL or cable modem) that provides Internet access. If
your network is not strictly a wireless network, you also need cabling and perhaps one or more switches to create
a wired network. This section covers what you need to know to set up and troubleshoot both a wired and wireless
network.
Designing a Wired Network
Core 1 Objective 2.3
Begin your network design by deciding where to place your router. If the router is also your wireless access point,
take care in where you place it. Place the wireless access point near the center of the area where you want your
wireless hotspot to maximize its range for users and minimize your Wi-Fi network’s exposure to unauthorized users
outside your building. The router also needs to have access to your modem, and the modem needs access to the
cable TV or phone jack where it receives service. For a business, the router, modem, and servers are often placed
in an electrical closet that can be locked, with additional wireless access points placed where additional coverage
is needed. Next, consider where the wired workstations will be placed. Position switches in strategic locations to
provide extra network drops to multiple workstations.
Some network cables might be wired inside walls of your building with wall jacks that use RJ-45 ports. These
cables might converge in an electrical closet or server room to connect to switches. If network cables are lying on
the floor, be sure to install them against the wall so they won’t be a trip hazard. To get the best performance from
your network, follow these tips:
● Make sure cables don’t exceed the recommended length (100 meters for twisted pair).
● Use twisted-pair cables rated at CAT-5e or higher. (CAT-6 gives better performance than CAT-5e for Gigabit
Ethernet, but it’s harder to wire and more expensive.)
● Use switches rated at the same speed as your router and network adapters.
● For Gigabit speed on the entire network, use all Gigabit switches, network adapters, and routers. However,
if some devices run at slower speeds, a switch or router can likely still support the higher speeds for other
devices on the network.
Figure 8-30 shows a possible inexpensive wiring job where two switches and a router are used to wire two
rooms for five workstations and a network printer. The only inside-wall wiring required is two back-to-back RJ-45
wall jacks on either side of the wall between the two rooms. The plan allows for all five desktop computers and
a network printer to be wired with cabling neatly attached to the baseboards of the office without being a trip
hazard.

Now let’s look at the tools you need to solve problems with network cabling, the details of how a network cable
is wired, and how you can create your own network cables by installing RJ-45 connectors on twisted-pair cables.
Tools Used by Network Technicians
Core 1 Objective 2.8
Here’s a list of tools a network technician might want in their toolbox:
● Loopback plug. A loopback plug can be used to test a network cable or port. To test a port, insert the loopback plug into the port. To test a cable, connect one end of the cable to a network port on a computer or
other device, and connect the loopback plug to the other end of the cable (see Figure 8-31). If the LED lights
on the network port light up, the cable and port are good. Another way to use a loopback plug is to find out
which port on a switch in an electrical closet matches up with a wall jack. Plug the loopback plug into the
wall jack. The connecting port on the switch in the closet lights up.

Figure 8-32 Use a cable tester pair to determine the type of cable and/or if the
cable is good
Base
Remote
To test a cable, connect each component
to the ends of the cable, and turn on the tester.
Lights on the tester will show you if the cable
is good and what type of cable you have. You’ll
need to read the user manual that comes with
the cable tester to know how to interpret the
lights.
You can also use the cable tester to find
the two ends of a network cable installed in
a building. Suppose you see several network
jacks on walls in a building, but you don’t know
which jacks connect back to the switch. Install
a short cable in each of the two jacks or a jack
and a port in a patch panel. A patch panel (see
Figure 8-33) provides multiple network ports
for cables that converge in one location such
as an electrical closet or server room. Each
port is numbered on the front of the panel.
Use the cable tester base and remote to test
the continuity between remote wall jacks and
ports in the patch panel, as shown in Figure
8-34. Whereas a loopback plug works with
live cables and ports, a cable tester works on
cables that are not live. You might damage a
cable tester if you connect it to a live circuit, so
before you start connecting the cable tester to
wall jacks, be sure that you turn off all devices
on the network.
● Wi-Fi analyzer. A Wi-Fi analyzer is software that can find Wi-Fi networks, determine signal strengths, help optimize Wi-Fi
signal settings, and help identify Wi-Fi
security threats. For example, you can use

● Cable tester. A cable tester, or cable certifier, is used to determine if a cable is good or to find out what
type it is if the cable is not labeled. You can also use a cable tester to locate the ends of a network cable in
a building. A cable tester has two components, the remote and the base (see Figure 8-32).

a Wi-Fi analyzer to find out which Wi-Fi channels are
being used before you pick your channels. You can
turn your smartphone into a Wi-Fi analyzer by installing a free or inexpensive app through your phone’s
app store (see Figure 8-35).
● Toner probe. A tone generator and probe, sometimes called a toner probe, is a two-part kit that is
used to find cables in the walls of a building. See
Figure 8-36. The toner connects to one end of the
cable and puts out a continuous or pulsating tone
on the cable. While the toner is putting out the tone,
you use the probe to search the walls for the tone.
The probe amplifies the audible tone, so you hear
it as a continuous or pulsating beep. The beeps get
louder when you are close to the cable and weaker
when you move the probe away from the cable. With
a little patience, you can trace the cable through the
walls. Some toners can put out tones up to 10 miles
on a cable and offer a variety of ways to connect
to the cable, such as clips and RJ-45 and RJ-11
connectors.
● Cable stripper. A cable stripper is used to build
your own network cable or repair a cable. Use the
cable stripper to cut away the plastic jacket or coating around the wires inside a twisted-pair cable so
you can install a connector on the end of the cable.
How to use cable strippers is covered later in the
module.
● Crimper. A crimper is used to attach a terminator
or connector to the end of a cable. It applies force
to pinch the connector to the wires in the cable to

● Network Tap. A network tap is used to provide a connection point for monitoring devices such as an
IDS or IPS system and allows the device to be “inline” with the communications on the network. The
device can then copy or monitor the traffic without affecting the data flow. A network tap is shown in
Figure 8-40.

● Punchdown tool. A punchdown tool (see Figure 8-38) is used to punch individual wires in a network cable
into their slots in a keystone RJ-45 jack, which is used in an RJ-45 wall jack. It can also be used to connect
the cable to a patch panel or punchdown block, shown in Figure 8-39. In a project at the end of this module,
you practice using a punchdown tool with a keystone jack.

Now that you know about the tools you need to wire networks, let’s see how the cables and connectors are
wired.
How Twisted-Pair Cables and Connectors Are Wired
Core 1 Objectives 2.8, 3.1
Two types of network cables can be used when building a network: a straight-through cable and a crossover cable.
A straight-through cable (also called a patch cable) is used to connect a computer to a switch or other network
device. A crossover cable is used to connect two like devices such as a switch to a switch or a computer to a computer (to make the simplest network of all).
The difference between a straight-through cable and a crossover cable is the way the transmit and receive lines
are wired in the connectors at each end of the cables. A crossover cable has the transmit and receive lines reversed
so that one device receives off the line on which the other device transmits. Before the introduction of Gigabit Ethernet, 10BaseT and 100BaseT required that a crossover cable be used to connect two like devices such as a switch to a
switch. Today’s devices that support Gigabit Ethernet use auto-uplinking, which means you can connect a switch to
a switch using a straight-through cable and the devices will negotiate the transmit and receive links, so data crosses
the connection successfully. Crossover cables are seldom used today except to connect a computer to a computer
to create a simple two-node network.
Twisted-pair copper wire cabling uses an RJ-45 connector that has eight pins, as shown in Figure 8-41. 10BaseT
and 100BaseT Ethernet use only four of these pins: pins 1 and 2 for transmitting data and pins 3 and 6 for receiving
data. The other pins can be used for phone lines or for power (using PoE). Gigabit Ethernet uses all eight pins to
transmit and receive data and can also transmit power on these same lines. Older telephone connections used an
RJ-11 connector that had only four pins. This connector was slightly smaller than the RJ-45 used on the eight wire
Ethernet cables today.

Twisted-pair cabling used with RJ-45 connectors is color-coded in four pairs: blue, orange, green, and brown, as
shown in Figure 8-42. Each pair has one solid wire and one striped wire. Two standards have been established in the
industry for wiring twisted-pair cabling and RJ-45 connectors: T568A and T568B. Both are diagrammed in Table 8-4.
The T568A standard has the green pair connected to pins 1 and 2 and the orange pair connected to pins 3 and 6.
The T568B standard has the orange pair using pins 1 and 2 and the green pair using pins 3 and 6, as shown in the
diagram and the table. For both standards, the blue pair uses pins 4 and 5, and the brown pair uses pins 7 and 8.

The T568A and T568B standards, as well as other network wiring standards and recommendations are overseen by the
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), Electronics Industries Alliance (EIA), and American National Standards
Institute (ANSI).
Note 4
If the wiring on one end of the cable matches the wiring on the other end, be it the T568A or T568B standard,
you have a straight-through cable. If you’re working on a 10BaseT or 100BaseT network and you use T568A wiring
on one end of the cable and T568B on the other end, you have a crossover cable (see the diagram on the left side
of Figure 8-42). For Gigabit Ethernet (1000BaseT) that
transmits data on all four pairs, you must cross the
green and orange pairs as well as the blue and brown
pairs to make a crossover cable (see the diagram on
the right side of Figure 8-42). Recall, however, that
crossover cables are seldom used on Gigabit Ethernet. When you buy a crossover cable, it is most likely
wired only for 10BaseT or 100BaseT networks. If you
ever find yourself needing to make a crossover cable,
be sure to cross all four pairs so the cable will work
on 10BaseT, 100BaseT, and 1000BaseT networks. You
can also buy an adapter to convert a straight-through
cable to a crossover cable, but the adapter most likely
will only cross two pairs and work only for 10BaseT
or 100BaseT networks, such as the adapter shown in
Figure 8-43.

Although it’s possible to mix standards on the same network, you should always be consistent with which standard you use. When you are wiring a network in a building that already has network wiring, be sure to find out if the
wiring is using T568A or T568B, and then be sure you always use that standard. If you don’t know which to use, use
T568B because it’s the most common.
Making a Straight-Through Cable Using T568B Wiring
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.1
It takes a little practice to make a good network straight-through cable, but you’ll get the hang of it after doing only
a couple of cables. Figure 8-44 shows the materials and tools you’ll need to make a network cable.
Here are the steps to make a straightthrough cable using the T568B standard:
1. Use wire cutters to cut the
twisted-pair cable the correct
length plus a few extra inches.
2. If your RJ-45 connectors include
boots, slide two boots onto the
cable. Be sure they’re each facing
the correct direction.
3. Use wire strippers to strip off
about two inches of the plastic
jacket from the end of the wire.
To do that, put the wire in the
stripper and rotate the stripper
around the wire to score the
jacket (see Figure 8-45). You can
then pull off the jacket.

4. Use wire cutters to start a cut into the jacket, and then use the rip cord to pull the jacket back a couple
of inches (see Figure 8-46). Next, cut off the rip cord and the jacket. You take the extra precaution of
removing the jacket because you might have nicked the wires with the wire strippers.
Applying Concepts Continued
Figure 8-46 Rip back the jacket, and then cut off the extra jacket
and rip cord
5. Untwist each pair of wires so you have eight separate wires. Smooth each wire to straighten out the kinks. Line up
the wires in the T568B configuration (refer to Table 8-4).
6. Holding the tightly lined-up wires between your fingers, use wire cutters to cut the wires off evenly, leaving a little
over an inch of wire. See Figure 8-47. To know how short to cut the wires, hold the RJ-45 connector up to the wires.
The wires must go all the way to the front of the connector. The jacket must go far enough into the connector so
that the crimp at the back of the connector will be able to solidly pinch the jacket.

You’ll find several YouTube videos on network wiring. An excellent video by Ferrules Direct for making a straightthrough cable is posted at youtube.com/watch?v=WvP0D0jiyLg.
Note 5
7. Be sure you have pin 1 of the connector lined up with the orange-and-white wire. Then insert the eight
wires in the RJ-45 connector. Guide the wires into the connector, making sure they reach all the way to the
front. (It helps to push up a bit as you push the wires into the connector.) You can jam the jacket firmly
into the connector. Look through the clear plastic connector to make sure the wires are lined up correctly,
that they all reach the front, and that the jacket goes past the crimp.
8. Insert the connector into the crimper tool. Use one hand to push the connector firmly into the crimper
as you use the other hand to crimp the connector. See Figure 8-48. Use plenty of force to crimp. The
eight blades at the front of the connector must pierce through to each copper wire to complete each of
the eight connections, and the crimp at the back of the connector must solidly crimp the cable jacket to
secure the cable to the connector (see Figure 8-49). Remove the connector from the crimper, and make
sure you can’t pull the connector off the wire.

Wi-Fi Networking
Core 1 Objective 2.3
Wi-Fi, or wireless fidelity, networking uses radio frequencies to transmit and receive data between the wireless access
point and the device connected to the network. Recall from the module “Networking Fundamentals” that you need
the wireless network name, called the SSID, to join the wireless network.
As shown in Table 8-1 at the beginning of this module, each 802.11 standard can transmit on different frequencies: 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz (gigahertz). By using these radio frequencies, we can transmit data between devices easily
because these frequencies are reserved for this special purpose. The 2.4 GHz frequency provides a longer transmit
distance but has a slower speed when compared to the short distance, high-speed connections provided by 5 GHz.
Refer to Table 8-1 for the maximum transmit speed for each Wi-Fi standard.
Wi-Fi Channels
A channel is a specific radio frequency within a broader frequency. For example, 2.412 GHz and 2.437 GHz are two
channels in the 2.4 GHz band. In the United States, the FCC, which regulates Wi-Fi, has made 11 channels available
for wireless communication in the 2.4 GHz band. To avoid channel overlap, however, devices in the 2.4 GHz band
select channels 1, 6, or 11, resulting in three nonoverlapping channels available for use. The 5 GHz band offers up to
24 nonoverlapping channels in the United States, although some of those channels are restricted in certain areas,
such as near an airport. For most networks, you can allow auto channel selection so the device scans for the least
busy channel. However, if you are trying to solve a problem with interference from a nearby wireless network, you
can manually set each network to a different channel and make the channels far apart to reduce interference. For
According to networking standards for wiring a keystone RJ-45 jack and a straight-through cable, you
can avoid crosstalk by removing the cable jacket to
expose no more than three inches of twisted-pair
wires, and you should untwist exposed twisted-pair
wires no more than a half inch.

Now you’re ready to terminate the other
end of the cable. Configure it to also use the

is good.

Troubleshooting Network Connections
Core 1 Objective 5.7
Troubleshooting networks is one of the primary tasks a help desk associate will be assigned in the course of their
job. You may be asked to resolve issues caused by a simple loss of power or connectivity or those resulting from
a broken network adapter or cable. Being able to quickly and thoroughly troubleshoot issues so employees and
clients can continue their own work is important. In this section of the module, you learn to troubleshoot several
network issues.
Limited or Slow Wired Connectivity
Core 1 Objective 5.7
Limited or slow wired connectivity to the network can be caused by many factors. When trying to resolve these
types of network connectivity issues, check the following:
● Hardware configuration errors, such as speed or duplex settings on the network interface card.
● Switch port settings, which should be verified with network administrator.
example, in the 2.4 GHz band, set the network on one WAP to channel 1, and set a nearby WAP’s network to channel 11. For one router, the Wi-Fi Settings page provides a dropdown menu to select a specific channel or to allow the
router to automatically select the least busy channel (see Figure 8-51).

Port Flapping
Core 1 Objective 5.7
Port flapping occurs when a particular interface or port on a switch is continually going up and down. This rapid
switching between statuses, or flapping, prevents devices from communicating on the network. When port flapping
occurs, check the following:
● The most likely cause of port flapping is a misconfiguration on the switch. To correct the problem, a technician should verify the configuration with the network administrator.
● Another cause of port flapping is bad cables. Check that cable connections to the port are solid. Try exchanging the cables.
● The SFP card that provides SFP ports on the switch might be bad. An SFP (small form-factor pluggable) card
provides various SFP card ports, such as the four ports shown in Figure 8-52. One slot has a card already
installed in it. Verify cable connections are solid, and try exchanging cables or exchanging the SFP card with
a known good one.
Figure 8-52 A fiber-optic SFP port with an LC fiber cable attached
● Check for updates to the switch firmware. Sometimes outdated firmware can cause problems.
Exam Tip
Some skills mentioned in this section, such as using Wireshark or configuring a managed switch, are described so you
have an idea of what to expect when troubleshooting a network. You learn to do these skills in later networking classes.
For the A1 Core 1 exam, you are expected to only know about these skills and tools—not necessarily how to use them.
● High usage by other network clients or users. Network monitoring software such as Wireshark (wireshark.
org) or other software applications can be used to capture and analyze traffic.
● Configuration issues with a router or modem. Solving this type of issue may require calling your ISP for
assistance.

Network Jitter and High Latency
Core 1 Objective 5.7
Network jitter, or fluctuations in latency on your network, can cause network communication disruptions. Recall
that latency is the measurement of time between when a packet is sent and when it is finally received by the end
device. High latency situations can occur because of high network use or because of the technology your network
uses for Internet connectivity. Satellite and wireless networks tend to have higher latency than a wired network. If
the network is experiencing jitter, try the following:
● Check network cable connections at both the local workstation and at the wall jack and from the wall jack
to the patch panel.
● Check for connectivity and activity lights on physical interfaces (the network ports on the computer, the
switch, or the SOHO router). For wireless connectivity, check for signal strength on the connected network.
● Check connectivity between network infrastructure, such as connections between a switch and a router
on the network. For a managed switch, verify with the network administrator how ports, including SFP
interfaces, are configured.
● To check for connectivity, use the ping command. You can ping another computer on the network or on
the Internet. For example, to check for connectivity on the Internet, ping a Google DNS server using its IP
address:
ping 8.8.8.8
VoIP Call Quality
Core 1 Objective 5.7
VoIP (voice over IP) phones require high throughput in order to ensure high quality of service (QoS)—which, in turn,
ensures that your phone calls are loud and clear, without echoing, delay, or static. Low QoS issues may be caused
by the following:
● Other services being prioritized over the phone call
● Lack of bandwidth
● Misconfiguration of the phone system
To troubleshoot VoIP issues, check to make sure the VoIP phone system is correctly configured. You may want
to isolate the phones to their own VLAN or subnet. You can also configure QoS settings on your network to prioritize
the VoIP applications and devices over other applications and devices using the network. Recall that to implement
QoS, priorities must be set on every device using the network, including the SOHO router and each network adapter
and OS on the network.
Intermittent Wireless and External Interference
Core 1 Objective 5.7
Because wireless networks are susceptible to interference from a variety of sources—including neighboring wireless networks, other RF devices such as cordless phones or radios, microwaves, or walls—these types of issues
can cause even experienced technicians to scratch their heads. The use of a wireless network analyzer—such as
inSSIDer, shown in Figure 8-53—or an RF spectrum analyzer device, such as the one shown in Figure 8-54—can help
identify the source of interference.

Client-Side Virtualization
Core 1 Objectives 4.1, 4.2
Virtualization in computing is when one physical machine hosts multiple activities that are normally done on multiple machines. Desktop virtualization, also called virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), is when one computer
provides multiple desktops for users. Each virtual desktop, or instance, is contained in its own virtual machine.
When a user ends a session with a VDI virtual desktop, the user can request that changes they made to the virtual
machine be saved until the next session. When changes are saved, the virtual desktop is said to be persistent and
working in a persistent environment. If each time the user starts a new session, the virtual desktop resets to its default
configuration and settings, the virtual desktop is said to be nonpersistent.
Note 7
With desktop virtualization, software called a hypervisor creates and manages the virtual machines (VMs). Each
VM that is managed by a hypervisor has its own virtual hardware (virtual motherboard, processor, RAM, hard drive,
NIC, and so forth) and acts like a physical computer. After an OS is installed in a VM, applications can be installed.
Figure 8-55 shows a Windows 10 Professional desktop with two virtual machines running that were created by
Oracle VirtualBox, which is hypervisor software. One VM is running Windows 10 and the other VM is running Ubuntu
Desktop, which is a Linux OS. You’ll learn about Linux in the Core 2 module “Linux and Scripting.” In the Core 2
module “Installing Windows,” you will complete an activity that involves installing Windows in a VM.
Figure 8-55 Two virtual machines running on a Windows 10 host, each with its own virtual hardware
and OS (Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux)

Virtualization can be used for many purposes, including the following:
● Cross-platform virtualization. With cross-platform virtualization, you install a different operating system in
a VM than the one installed on your host machine supporting the VM. One reason to use cross-platform virtualization is when you install Linux in a VM on your Windows 10 laptop so that you can learn to use this OS.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Application virtualization. You can run an application in a VM that is not meant for your normal operating system or platform, a practice referred to as application virtualization. For example, if you need to
run an old application compiled for Windows 95, you can install Windows 95 in a VM on your Windows 10
desktop and run the legacy software in the Windows 95 VM. In another example, you can create a VM on
your Windows 10 desktop, install Linux in the VM, and install Apache HTTP Server (a web server) in Linux.
● Sandboxing. A sandbox is an isolated environment where users and developers can learn and experiment
safely without affecting the live environment. VMs are a popular sandboxing method for researching, experimenting, and testing. Researching computer security issues such as examining the latest malware within a
virtual machine can help isolate the malware from the rest of your network and system. Software and app
developers may use sandboxing in a VM for test development before publicly publishing it.
Setting Up Client-Side Virtualization
Core 1 Objective 4.2
Desktop virtualization can be implemented in the cloud or on premises. On premises, an IT support technician might
be called on to set up client-side virtualization on a workstation to host multiple VMs. The first step is to make sure
the workstation can support the hypervisor and VMs.
Customize a Virtualization Workstation
Here are the requirements for a workstation that will host multiple virtual machines:
● Maximum CPU cores. Each VM has its own virtual processor, so it’s important that the host’s processor is a
multicore processor. All dual-core or higher processors sold today support hardware-assisted virtualization
(HAV), which is a technology that enhances the processor support for virtual machines. For Intel processors,
this feature is called Intel VT. For AMD processors, the technology is called AMD-V.
● The motherboard BIOS/UEFI. Most of today’s motherboards support HAV, and it must be enabled in the
BIOS/UEFI setup. Figure 8-56 shows the UEFI setup screen for one motherboard where the HAV feature is
called Intel Virtualization Technology. When you enable the feature, also verify that all subcategories are
enabled under the main category for hardware virtualization.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Maximum RAM. Some hypervisors are designed so that each VM that is running ties up all the RAM assigned
to it. Therefore, you need large amounts of RAM when a computer is running several VMs.
● Lots of storage space. Each VM has its own virtual hard drive (VHD), which is a file stored on the physical
hard drive that acts like an independent hard drive, complete with its own boot sector and file systems.
You can configure this VHD to be a fixed size or dynamically expanding. The fixed size takes up hard drive
space whether the VM uses the space or not. A dynamically allocated VHD increases in capacity as the VM
uses the space. Each VM must have an operating system installed, which takes about 20 GB for a Windows
10 installation. In addition, each application installed in a VM requires storage space. Make sure you have
adequate storage space for all the VMs the customer plans to create. See the requirements provided by the
hypervisor manufacturer for additional recommendations.
● Network requirements. If multiple VMs on the workstation will be running at the same time, you’ll need a
fast network connection; make sure the NIC supports Gigabit Ethernet. Later, when you set up the workstation, it might require a static IP address so others on the network can reach the VMs. Also consider using two
NICs in the workstation: The hypervisor can run all the VMs through one NIC that has the static IP address
assignment, and the other NIC is used for other network activity on the host workstation. Some network
administrators may also choose to set up the VMs in their own VLAN. When deciding how to use the overall
budget for a virtualization workstation, prioritize the number of CPU cores and the amount of installed RAM.
Install and Configure a Hypervisor
A hypervisor offers a way to configure each VM, including which virtual hardware is installed. For example, when you
launch Oracle VirtualBox, the VirtualBox Manager window shown on the left side of Figure 8-57 appears. To create
a new VM, click New in the upper-left corner, and follow the directions on-screen. To change the configuration of a
VM, select the VM in the left pane and click Settings. In the Settings dialog box, click Storage, as shown on the right
side of Figure 8-57, to install and uninstall virtual hard drives and optical drives in the VM.

Notice in the Settings dialog box in Figure 8-57 that the VM, which does not yet have an OS installed, has two
hard drives and an optical drive. The virtual hard drive named Windows 10 Pro.vdi is connected to SATA port 0 and
will contain the Windows 10 installation. VirtualHardDrive1.vhd, a backup hard drive for this VM, is the same size
(50 GB) and is connected through SATA port 1. The virtual optical drive is connected to SATA port 2 and holds the
Windows 10 ISO file, ready for installation on the VM. An ISO file holds the image of a CD or DVD and can be used to
provide Windows installation files. When you mount this file to the VM, you can install Windows in the VM from this
virtual DVD; many hypervisor programs will perform this step for you during setup of a new VM.

A VM can connect to a local network in the same way as other computers using the host computer’s network
interface, and it can share and use shared resources on the network. Alternatively, you can keep the VM isolated from
the physical network while connected to other VMs on the host computer, or you can keep it completely isolated
from all physical and virtual networks. In the Network pane of the Settings dialog box, you can control the number
and type of installed network adapters—up to four adapters for this hypervisor, as shown in Figure 8-59.
To boot up a VM, select it in the left pane, and click Start in the menu. The VM boots up and works the same
way as a physical computer.
Securing a Virtual Machine
Core 1 Objective 4.2
Just like a physical machine, a virtual machine is susceptible to hackers and malware. When supporting a VM that
holds sensitive data and has network and Internet connectivity or is in a public area, keep these points in mind for
securing VM resources:
● Secure the VM within the VM. Using the OS installed in the VM, follow all the security measures you are
learning throughout this text. For example, be sure to configure the OS firewall in the VM, keep updates current, install and run anti-malware software, require passwords for all user accounts in the VM, and encrypt
data folders.
● VMs should be isolated for best security. One major advantage of using VMs on a workstation is that a VM
on one workstation is better isolated from a VM on another because the workstations provide an extra layer
of protection. Also, the host workstation for VMs should not be used for web surfing or other activities that
might compromise its VMs. If a workstation has more than one NIC, a VM that should be kept especially
secure can be isolated by dedicating a NIC solely to this VM and putting this NIC on its own subnet.
● Secure the files that hold a VM. You can move a VM from one computer to another by moving the files that
contain the VM. Be sure these files that hold the VM are secured with permissions that allow access only
to specific local or network users and apply file encryption to the files.
● Secure the host computer. Protect your VMs by applying security measures to protect the host computer
that holds the VMs. For example, run anti-malware, keep Windows updated, require password authentication to sign in to the host computer, harden the host computer’s firewall, and isolate it on the network in a
protected subnet.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to secure a virtual machine installed on a host
computer.
Just as virtualization can be set up on your own hardware, let’s look how virtualization can be expanded across the
Internet using a third party’s hardware for your own computing needs. To the cloud we go!
Cloud Computing
Core 1 Objective 4.1
In the module “Networking Fundamentals,” you learn about server resources available on a network, and in this
module, you learn some ways to virtualize network resources. Not all a network’s resources reside on the local
network. Cloud computing is when a vendor or corporation makes computing resources available over the Internet.

For example, Google Drive, iCloud Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive are cloud file storage services that allow you to
store your files in the cloud. These services work with synchronization apps on mobile devices and computers to
sync data and settings under a user account—such as a Google, Apple, or Microsoft account—between the cloud
and devices using the account. Cloud computing can also provide many other types of services and resources,
including applications, network services, websites, database servers, specialized developer applications, and virtual
desktops in VMs.
The current trend for both small and large businesses is to use cloud computing rather than local computing
resources to expand current and future computing needs. As an IT technician, you need to understand how cloud
computing works and how to support it.
Deployment Models for Cloud Computing
Core 1 Objective 4.1
Cloud computing services are delivered by a variety of deployment models, depending on who manages the cloud
and who has access to it. The main deployment models you are likely to encounter are as follows:
● Public cloud. In a public cloud, services are provided over the Internet to the general public. Google or
Yahoo! email services are examples of public cloud deployment.
● Private cloud. In a private cloud, services are established on an organization’s own servers or established virtually for a single organization’s private use. For example, an insurance company might have a
centralized data center that provides private cloud services to its branch offices throughout the United
States.
● Community cloud. In a community cloud, services are shared among multiple organizations with a common interest, but the services are not available publicly. For example, a medical database might be shared
among all hospitals in a geographic area, or government agencies might share regulatory requirements. In
these cases, the community cloud could be hosted internally by one or more of the organizations involved
or hosted externally by a third-party provider.
● Hybrid cloud. A hybrid cloud is a combination of public, private, and community clouds used by the same
organization. For example, a company might store inventory databases in a private cloud but use a public
cloud email service.
Characteristics of Cloud Computing
Core 1 Objective 4.1
Regardless of the service provided, all cloud computing service models incorporate the following elements:
● Elastic services and storage. Rapid elasticity refers to the service’s ability to be scaled up or down as the
need level changes for a particular customer without requiring hardware changes that could be costly for
the customer. Layers of services—such as applications, storage space, or number of users—can be added
or removed when requested. Services can also be adjusted automatically, depending on the options made
available by the service vendor.
● Metered utilization. Resources offered by a cloud computing vendor—such as storage, applications, bandwidth, and other services—are measured, or metered, for billing purposes and/or for the purpose of limiting
any customer’s use of that resource according to the service agreement.
● Shared resources. By enabling multiple customers to share the use and cost of cloud resources, a cloud
service provider assists in reducing the cost of ownership for themselves and their customers.
● High availability. Cloud resources are considered highly available because they can be configured and
turned on at a moment’s notice. These services can be replicated, or copied, to data centers around the
globe to ensure they are available even if one data center suffers an outage.
● File synchronization. Just as the services within the cloud are highly available, data files can be
synchronized across the network to ensure all systems and users are working with the same versions of
the same files.

Cloud Computing Service Models
Core 1 Objectives 2.2, 4.1
Cloud computing service models are categorized by the types of services they provide. The National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a standard definition for each category, which varies by the division
of labor implemented. For example, as shown on the left side of Figure 8-60, an organization is traditionally responsible for its entire network, top to bottom. In this arrangement, the organization has its own network infrastructure
devices, manages its own network services and data storage, and purchases licenses for its own operating systems
and applications. The three cloud computing service models illustrated on the right side of Figure 8-60 incrementally
increase the amount of management responsibilities outsourced to cloud computing vendors.
Figure 8-60 At each progressive level, the vendor takes over more
computing responsibility for the customer

laaS PaaS SaaS
The following list describes these service models:
● IaaS. With IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), the customer rents hardware—including servers, storage,
and networking—and can use these hardware services virtually. Customers are responsible for their own
application installations, data management, and backup. In most situations, customers are also responsible
for their own operating systems. For example, customers might rent several VMs and use them for servers
by installing an OS in each VM and hosting applications such as web servers, email servers, DNS servers, or
DHCP services, or by hosting productivity software such as Microsoft Office for employees. IaaS is ideal for
fast-changing applications, to test software, or for startup businesses looking to save money by not having
to invest in hardware. Examples of IaaS providers are Amazon Web Services (aws.amazon.com), Windows
Azure (azure.microsoft.com), and Google Compute Engine (cloud.google.com).
● PaaS. With PaaS (Platform as a Service), a customer rents hardware, operating systems, and some applications that might support other applications the customer may install. PaaS is popular with software developers who require access to multiple platforms during the development process. A developer can build and
test an application on a PaaS virtual machine made available over the web, and then throw out the machine
and start over with a new one with a few clicks in their browser window. Applications that a PaaS vendor
might provide to a developer are tailored to the specific needs of the project, such as an application to manage a database of test data. Examples of PaaS services include Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.
● SaaS. With SaaS (Software as a Service), customers use applications hosted on the service provider’s hardware and operating systems, and typically access the applications through a web browser. Applications are
provided through an online user interface and are compatible with a multitude of devices and operating systems. Online email services, such as Gmail and Yahoo!, are good examples of SaaS. Google offers an entire suite

of virtual software applications through Google Cloud and its other embedded products. Except for the interface itself (the device and whatever browser software is required to access the website), the vendor provides
every level of support from network infrastructure through data storage and application implementation.
● XaaS. In the XaaS (Anything as a Service or Everything as a Service) model, the “X” represents an unknown,
just as it does in algebra. Here, the cloud can provide any combination of functions, depending on a
customer’s exact needs. The XaaS model is not shown in Figure 8-60.
As you have seen in this module, networks can be small and housed within a single building or extend around
the globe, like the Internet. You can use various types of hardware and cables to set up, manage, and expand your
network to meet your changing requirements. Expanding your software systems using virtualization and the cloud
can also help you meet those changing needs.
Module Summary
Types of Networks and Network Connections
● Networks are categorized by size as a PAN, LAN, WLAN, MAN, or WAN. A SAN is a specialized, high-speed
network for storing and sharing files.
● Performance of a network technology is measured in bandwidth and latency.
● Ways to connect to the Internet include satellite, fiber optic, cable, DSL, cellular, and WISP.
Identifying Network Hardware and Infrastructure
● Networking hardware used on local networks can include switches, routers, wireless access points, cables,
and connectors.
● Switches can be unmanaged or managed, which allows for configuration.
● Most wired local networks use twisted-pair cabling that can be unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable or
shielded twisted-pair (STP) cable. Twisted-pair cable is rated by category, with the most common being
CAT-5, CAT-5e, CAT-6, and CAT-6A.
● Fiber-optic cables can use one of the following connectors: ST, LC, or SC. Connectors should be selected to
match the equipment being connected.
● Power over Ethernet (PoE) sends power over Ethernet cables for supported devices.
● IoT devices increase quality of life and convenience by connecting home and appliances to the Internet.
● SDN, SCADA systems, UTM technologies, and load balancers all can be integrated into a network to expand
its functionality, increase security monitoring, and optimize the availability of the network.
Configuring Network Infrastructure
● Tools used to manage and troubleshoot network wiring and connectors include a loopback plug, cable tester,
Wi-Fi analyzer, toner probe, cable stripper, crimper, punchdown tool, and network tap.
● The RJ-45 connector has eight pins. Four pins (pins 1, 2, 3, and 6) are used to transmit and receive data
using the 10BaseT and 100BaseT speeds. Using 1000BaseT speed, all eight pins are used for transmitting
and receiving data.
● Two standards used to wire network cables are T568A and T568B. The difference between the two standards
is that the orange twisted-pair wires are reversed in the RJ-45 connector from the green twisted-pair wires.
● Either T568A or T568B can be used to wire a network. To avoid confusion, don’t mix the two standards in
a building.
● Use wire strippers, wire cutters, and a crimper to make network cables. A punchdown tool is used to terminate cables in a patch panel or keystone RJ-45 jack. Be sure to use a cable tester to test or certify a cable
you have just made.
● Wi-Fi, or wireless fidelity, networking uses radio frequencies to transmit and receive data between the wireless access point and the device connected to the network.

Troubleshooting Network Connections
● Common issues of networks include limited or slow connectivity, port flapping, jitter or latency issues, quality of service issues for VoIP connections, and interference issues for wireless networks.
● Troubleshooting steps should include checking hardware and software configurations, allocation of bandwidth for high QoS services such as VoIP, and monitoring for interference from other networks or devices
that are nearby.
Client-Side Virtualization
● Client-side virtualization is done by creating multiple virtual machines, each with its own virtual desktop,
on a physical machine using a hypervisor.
● Virtualization can be used to allow for cross-platform virtualization, for application virtualization for support, or even to set up a sandbox environment to experiment with different operating systems or develop
software.
● Considerations for virtualized systems include ensuring enough physical hardware resources are allocated
for each virtual machine and ensuring the environment is maintained securely.
Cloud Computing
● Cloud computing is providing computing resources over the Internet to customers.
● A public cloud service is available to the public, and a private cloud service is kept on an organization’s own
servers or made available by a vendor only for a single organization’s private use. A community cloud is
shared between multiple organizations, and a hybrid cloud is any combination of these deployment models.
● All cloud computing service models incorporate rapid elasticity, metered utilization, resource sharing, high
availability, and file synchronization.
● Cloud computing service models—including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and XaaS—are categorized by the types of
services they provide and the degree that a third-party service or vendor is responsible for the resources.

Hands-On Projects
Researching a Network Upgrade
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objectives: 2.2, 2.3, 2.7, 3.1
An IT support technician is often called on to research equipment to maintain or improve a computer or network
and make recommendations for purchase. Suppose you are asked to upgrade a small network that consists of one
switch and four computers from 100BaseT to Gigabit Ethernet. The switch connects to a router that already supports
Gigabit Ethernet. Do the following to price the hardware needed for this upgrade:
1. Find three switches by different manufacturers that support Gigabit Ethernet and have at least five ports.
Save or print the webpages describing each switch.
2. Compare the features and prices of the three switches. What additional information might you want to
know before you make your recommendation for a small business network?
3. Find three network adapters by different manufacturers to install in the desktop computers to support
Gigabit Ethernet. Save or print webpages for each NIC.
4. Compare features of the three network adapters. What additional information do you need to know before
you make your recommendation?
5. Make your recommendations based on the moderate (middle-of-the-road) choices. What is the total price of
the upgrade, including one switch and four network adapters?
6. What is one more question you need to have answered about other equipment before you can complete
the price of the upgrade? Explain how you would find the answer to your question.
Hands-On Project 8-1
Wiring a Keystone Jack
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objectives: 2.8, 3.1
A keystone RJ-45 jack is used in a network wall jack. To practice wiring a keystone jack, you’ll need a wire stripper, wire
cutter, twisted-pair cabling, keystone jack, and punchdown tool. Here are the instructions to wire a keystone jack:
1. Using a wire stripper and wire cutter, strip and trim back the jacket from the twisted-pair wire, leaving about
two inches of wire exposed. Untwist the wires only so far as necessary so each wire can be inserted in the
color-coded slot in the jack. The untwisted wire should be no longer than a half inch. Why are twists so
important when wiring connectors and jacks?

Figure 8-63 Use a punchdown tool to punch the wires into the keystone jack,
and then place the cover in position
3. Using the punchdown tool, make sure the blade side of the tool is on the outside of the jack. (The
punchdown tool has “Cut” embedded on the blade side of the tool.) Push down with force to punch each
wire into its slot and cut off the wire on the outside edge of the slot. It might take a couple of punches to
do the job. See the left side of Figure 8-63. Place the jack cover over the jack, as shown on the right side of
Figure 8-63.

4. The jack can now be inserted into the back side of a wall faceplate (see Figure 8-64). Make sure the wires in
the jack are at the top of the jack. If you look closely at the faceplate, you can see the arrow pointing up. It’s
important that the wires in the jack be at the top so dust doesn’t settle on these wires over time. Use screws
to secure the faceplate to the wall receptacle. Be sure to use a cable tester to check the network cable from
its jack to the other end to make sure the wiring is good. When wiring a building, testing the cable and its
two connections is called certifying the cable. Use a loopback plug or cable tester with cable to verify your
jack works. Is it certified?

Exploring Packet Tracer
Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 2.8
In the module “Networking Fundamentals,” you installed Packet Tracer and created a very basic network. In this
project, you work through three modules of the Packet Tracer Introduction course to take a brief tour of the simulator interface and create a more complex network in Packet Tracer. Notice in the Packet Tracer course that the
activities refer to the OSI model instead of the TCP/IP model. Review the section titled “The OSI Model for Network
Communication” in the module “Networking Fundamentals” for a brief refresher. Then complete the following steps
to access your course:
1. Return to the Networking Academy website (netacad.com), sign in, and click Launch Course. You’ve already
downloaded Packet Tracer, so you can skip chapter 1.

Introduction
Previous modules have focused on supporting personal computers. This module moves on to discuss supporting
mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Most cell phones are also smartphones, which are often used to
surf the web, access email, and manage apps and data. This module is intended to show you how to support a variety of mobile devices, including those you might not own or use. Technicians are often expected to do such things!
As an IT support technician, you need to know about the hardware used with mobile devices and how to help a user
configure and troubleshoot these devices.
Many employees expect to be able to use their mobile devices to access, synchronize, and edit data on the
corporate network. Therefore, to protect this data, corporations require that employee mobile devices be secured
and that data, settings, and apps be synchronized to other storage locations. In this module, you learn how you can
synchronize content on mobile devices to a personal computer or to storage in the cloud (on the Internet). Finally, in
this module, you learn about tools and resources available for troubleshooting mobile devices. In the Core 2 module
“Mobile Device Security,” you learn how to support mobile operating systems (iOS, iPadOS, and Android) and apps
and how to secure mobile devices.
Exam Tip
This module covers supporting mobile device hardware covered on the A1 Core 1 220-1001 exam. Content about
mobile device operating systems and apps on the A1 Core 2 220-1102 exam is covered in the module “Mobile Device
Security.” Both modules contain content on troubleshooting mobile devices.
Mobile Devices, Operating Systems,
Connections, and Accessories
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2.3
Mobile devices vary considerably by size, functionality,
available connection types, and primary purpose(s),
not to mention cost. A smartphone is primarily a cell
phone that also can send text messages with photos,
videos, or other multimedia content attached; surf
the web; manage email; play games; take photos and
videos; and download and use small apps. Most smartphones use touch screens for input (see Figure 9-1) and
allow for voice input.
A tablet is a computing device with a touch screen
that is larger than a smartphone and has functions
similar to a smartphone. As you can see in Figure 9-2, a
tablet might come with a detachable keyboard or a stylus. All tablets can connect to Wi-Fi networks and use
Bluetooth or NFC (near-field communication), which
you learn about later in this module, to wirelessly connect to nearby devices. Some tablets have the ability to
use a cellular network for data transmissions and phone
calls. Installed apps can be used to make voice phone
calls, send text messages, and make video calls using
data transmissions. When a tablet can be used to make
a phone call, the distinction between a smartphone and
a tablet is almost nonexistent, except for size.

Mobile Device Operating Systems
Core 1 Objective 1.3
The operating system for a mobile device is installed at the factory. Android OS by Google (google.com and
android.com) is based on Linux and holds about 72% of the global mobile OS market. iOS for iPhones and iPadOS
for iPads by Apple (apple.com) are based on macOS, and together hold about 27% of the global mobile OS market.
Combined, Android, iOS, and iPadOS command about 99% of market share. Let’s get familiar with each OS.
Get to Know an Android Device
Core 1 Objective 1.3
In the past, releases of Android were named after desserts. The last dessert release was Android Pie (version 9.0) in
2018. Now releases are merely numbered for the public. The current release is Android 11.0, and Android 12.0 has
been released to a few devices. When a new release publishes, device manufacturers gradually release it. Not all
Android devices can support a new release; it’s up to the manufacturer to decide if a particular model can handle a
new release and when that model gets the release.
Most current Android mobile devices have power and volume control buttons on the right side, and some have
a third Google Assistant button to enable voice input on the left side. Earlier versions of Android used three soft
buttons at the bottom of the screen, but Android 11 uses swipes or gestures rather than buttons to navigate the OS.
Some of these gestures are described in Figure 9-3.

On Android phones, up to five apps or groups of apps can be pinned to the favorites tray just above the Google
search box. Apps in the favorites tray stay put as you move from screen to screen by swiping left or right. Some
other useful tools include the following:
●● App drawer. Swipe up anywhere on the screen to access the app drawer, which lists and manages all apps
installed on the phone. Press and hold an app in the app drawer to add it to an existing home screen or to
add more home screens.
●● Notifications. Swipe down the notifications shade from the top of the screen to see notifications that provide alerts and related information about apps and social media and quick settings to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and
auto-rotate. See Figure 9-5A. Swipe down again to see more settings, including the cog icon to access the
Settings app. See Figure 9-5B.
Android is installed by various device manufacturers before the device leaves the factory, and these manufacturers
can customize the OS and how it works. Therefore, specific step-by-step directions will vary from device to device, even
when the devices all use the same Android release. Remember that you don’t need to memorize the steps—just learn
general procedures for supporting a variety of mobile devices.

Manage Android Apps
Android apps are sold or freely distributed by any source or vendor. For example,
you can open the Chrome browser and download an app from a website, such as
the Amazon Appstore for Android at amazon.com or directly from the website of a
developer. However, the official source for apps is Google Play at play.google.com.
A Google account is required to download content from Google Play and can be
associated with any valid email address. Here’s how to handle apps:
●● Install an app. To get an app from Play Store, tap the Play Store app on
the home screen. (If you don’t see the app icon on the home screen, tap
the app drawer and then tap Play Store.) Search for an app, and follow
directions to install one.
●● Open and close an app. To open an
app, tap it on a home screen, or open
the app drawer and tap the app. To
leave the app, swipe up from the bottom of the screen or, when using 3-button navigation, tap the Home button.
To close the app, swipe up slowly
from the bottom of the screen (or tap
the Overview button). All open apps
appear in small windows. To close an
app, swipe it up. If an app refuses to
close, you can force it: open the Settings app, tap Apps & notifications,
tap the running app, and then tap
FORCE STOP (see Figure 9-7).
●● Delete or uninstall an app. To uninstall an app, press the app icon,
tap App info, and tap UNINSTALL.
Another way to delete or uninstall an
app is to open the Play Store app, tap
your Google account profile icon (your
photo), tap Manage apps & devices,
tap Manage, tap the app, and then tap
Uninstall (see Figure 9-8). Sometimes
an Update option is also available
on this screen. Also note that some
embedded apps, such as the Phone
app, can’t be uninstalled.

One step in troubleshooting an OS is to update it. To update Android, in Settings,
tap About phone, Android version, and Google Play system update. Know that
a device might not be able to update to the latest version of Android.
Note 3
●● Settings app. To open Settings, tap the cog icon in the second notifications
area, or open the app drawer and tap Settings. Most of the settings you
need to use to support a mobile device are contained in the Settings app
(see Figure 9-6). You can open the Settings app and search through its
menus and submenus until you find what you need. If you get stuck, do a
quick web search or check the user guide for the device.

Get to Know iOS and iPadOS by Apple
Core 1 Objective 1.3
Apple Inc. (apple.com) develops, manufactures, and sells the Apple iPhone (a smartphone) and iPad (a handheld tablet). The latest releases for both OSs are versions 15. Apple maintains strict standards on its products, which means
iOS and iPadOS are exceptionally stable and bug free; they are also very easy and intuitive operating systems to use.
iPhones have volume control buttons on the left side of the device and a physical side button on the upper-right
side of the device. iPads have a top button on the top right side and volume buttons on the right side. Older devices
also have a home button on the front of the device. The user interface is shown in Figure 9-9 for an iPad; an iPhone
interface looks and works the same. Apps can be pinned to the dock at the bottom of the screen.
Figure 9-9 Access the dock on an iPad by swiping up from the bottom of the screen

Other useful tools include the following:
●● Control Center. Swipe down from the upper-right corner to view the Control Center, where you can change
basic settings such as brightness, volume, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Use the Settings app to adjust which settings are available in the control center.
●● Settings app. To open the Settings app, tap the Settings icon on the home screen. Just as with Android,
the Settings app is the go-to place to manage the device, apps, and the OS. See Figure 9-10. For example,
to manage iOS updates, in the Settings app, tap General and Software Update. You can set the device to
automatically download and install updates or to download updates but not install them until you allow it. Source: Apple Inc.

Manage iOS and iPadOS Apps
You can get Android apps from many sources, but the only place to go for an iOS/iPadOS app is Apple, which is the
sole distributor of iOS apps at its App Store. (Also, entertainment, including movies and music, is available at the
Apple iTunes Store.) Other developers can write apps for the iPhone or iPad, but these apps must be sent to Apple
for close scrutiny. If they pass muster, they are distributed by Apple on its website. Apple offers app development
tools, including the iOS SDK (software development kit), at developer.apple.com.
When you first purchase an iPad or iPhone, you activate it by signing in to the device with an Apple ID, or user
account; using a valid email address and password; and associating the account with a credit card number. You need
an Apple ID to download an app from the App Store. Here’s how to manage apps:
●● Open and close apps. Tap an app icon to open it. To leave the app, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.
(For older devices with a Home button, press the Home button.) To close an app, swipe up slowly from the
bottom of the screen. All open apps appear in small windows. Swipe up to close each app. (For older devices
with a Home button, double-press the Home button to view all open apps. Swipe up to close each app.)
●● Install and uninstall apps. Open the App Store app to search for and install an app. To delete or uninstall an
app, press and hold the app icon, and tap Remove App or Delete App. Alternately, hold down the app until all
icons start to jiggle. As the icons jiggle, press the dash beside an app icon to delete it. See Figure 9-11. To stop
the jiggling, tap Done in the top-right corner of the screen.

Wireless Connections for Mobile Devices
Core 1 Objectives 1.3, 1.4
A mobile device might have several antennas—primarily cellular, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, and NFC. The device uses a
Wi-Fi or cellular antenna to connect to a LAN (local area network) or WAN (wide area network) and uses Bluetooth or
NFC to connect to a PAN (personal area network). Settings on the device allow you to enable or disable each antenna.
Network connections are configured using the Settings app. Let’s look at each type of LAN, WAN, and PAN connection. Source: Apple Inc.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that expects you to decide how to configure a Wi-Fi, cellular data, or
Bluetooth connection on a mobile device.
Two examples of LAN connections on a mobile device are when Wi-Fi is used to connect to a local network and
when a device creates its own mobile Wi-Fi hotspot.
Wi-Fi Connections to a LAN
Core 1 Objectives 1.3, 1.4
Most mobile devices have Wi-Fi capability. On the Wi-Fi settings screen, you can add a Wi-Fi connection, manage
existing networks, view available Wi-Fi hotspots, see which Wi-Fi network you are connected to, turn Wi-Fi off and
on, and decide whether the device should ask the user before joining a Wi-Fi network. When the device is within
Most of us rarely follow step-by-step directions
when learning to use a new device—until when “all
else fails, read the directions.” When you are called
on to support a mobile device that you don’t own
or normally use, it’s helpful to begin by looking for
how to open the Settings app and browse through
settings. The information presented in this part of
the module can give you an idea of what to look
for, and you can likely figure out the specific steps
for yourself.

range of Wi-Fi networks, it displays the list of networks. Select
one to connect. If the Wi-Fi network is secured, enter the security
key to complete the connection. To change to a different Wi-Fi
hotspot, tap the name of the network, and select a new one from
the list of available networks (see Figure 9-12). Searching for a
Wi-Fi network can drain battery power. To make a battery charge
last longer, disable Wi-Fi when you’re not using it.
Mobile Hotspots and Tethering
Core 1 Objective 1.3
When a mobile device is connected to the Internet by way of its cellular WAN connection, you can allow other computers and devices
to use this same connection. For example, in Figure 9-13, the smartphone is tethered by USB to a laptop so that the laptop can use
the cellular network to connect to the Internet. If the smartphone
has Wi-Fi capabilities, it can create its own Wi-Fi hotspot for other
computers and devices to connect to wirelessly. An app on the
smartphone controls these connections. To use your phone for
tethering and for providing mobile hotspots, your carrier subscription must allow it. Also, know the extra burden on the phone can
cause the battery to drain quicker and perhaps even overheat.
Cellular WAN Connections
Core 1 Objectives 1.3, 1.4
Smartphones—and some laptops, tablets, and wearable mobile
devices—can connect to a cellular WAN if they have cellular capability and a subscription to the cellular network carrier. Recall
from the module “Network Infrastructure and Cloud Computing”
that a cellular network provided by a wireless carrier (for example, AT&T or Verizon) is used for voice, text, and data communication. As shown in Figure 9-14, cellular voice and SMS (Short
Message Service) text messages transmit over
the carrier’s cellular network, and cellular data
is sent from the carrier’s cellular network to the
Internet for distribution.
The following are two older radio bands
a carrier might use on its cellular network for
voice and SMS text communication:
●● CDMA. CDMA (Code Division Multiple
Access) communication is more popular
in the USA than other nations and does
not require a SIM card.
●● GSM. GSM (Global System for Mobiles)
communication is a global standard
used in many nations and requires a SIM
card installed in the device.
Older cell phones were built to support
GSM or CDMA, but not both. Newer cell phones

can support either technology. Both GSM and CDMA are being replaced by newer technologies, although they are still
used as backups for voice calls in locations where more modern coverage is weak. Most carriers have announced
they will stop supporting GSM and CDMA by the end of 2022.
Whereas GSM and CDMA are used only for voice and SMS texting, these standards can transmit cellular data
(voice, text, video and graphics) to the Internet:
●● 2G. The 2G standard was first used with GSM to transmit secured voice, text messages, and limited data. It
was soon followed by a CDMA version of 2G that was slightly faster.
●● 3G. The 3G standard was faster than 2G and used with CDMA and GSM. 3G can achieve download speeds
up to 21 Mbps.
●● 4G and 4G LTE. The 4G standard was faster than 3G but was soon replaced by an even faster standard: 4G
LTE. 4G and 4G LTE don’t require the help of CDMA or GSM, which is why those older standards are being
phased out. 4G LTE can achieve up to 1 Gbps speeds and requires a SIM card to function. 4G was the first
standard that allowed a device to support a mobile hotspot.
●● 5G. The 5G standard is the up-and-coming standard, and it currently has an average speed of 150 Mbps,
with peak speeds up to 10 Gbps.
As noted, although CDMA does not require a SIM card, 4G LTE does—which is why all cell phones in the United
States now use SIM cards. To make a cellular data connection, you must have a subscription with your carrier that
includes a SIM card and cellular data plan. Here is information that might be used when a connection is first made
to the carrier’s WAN or when troubleshooting that connection:
●● The IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a unique number that identifies each mobile phone
or tablet device worldwide. It’s usually reported within the About menu in the OS (see Figure 9-15), and it
might also be printed on a sticker on the device, such as behind the battery.

If your phone gets stolen and you notify your carrier, the carrier can block its use based on the IMEI and alert other
carriers to the stolen IMEI. Also, before buying a used phone, check its IMEI against blacklists of stolen phones by doing
a Google search on imei blacklist check.

●● The IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber
Identity) is a unique number that identifies a
cellular subscription for a device or subscriber,
along with its home country and mobile network. This number is stored on the SIM card.
For older phones that don’t use SIM cards, the
number is kept in a database maintained by
the carrier and is associated with the IMEI.
Figure 9-15 The IMEI value identifies a mobile
device worldwide
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to identify and distinguish between GSM and CDMA technologies, and
might give you a scenario that requires you to know
which communication technology a device is using.
SIM cards come in various sizes and install in a pop-out
tray on the side of a phone. Alternately, an eSIM card
is embedded on the motherboard and never removed.
For SIM cards, when you switch carriers for your device
you exchange cards. For eSIM cards, to switch carriers,
you scan a QR code sent to you by the new carrier or
use an app to make the switch.

Manage Cellular Data and Roaming
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 1.4
Looking back at Figure 9-14, you can see that a smartphone can use cellular data or Wi-Fi to access the Internet. In certain
situations, you might want to disable cellular data or disable cellular roaming. The advantage of disabling cellular data
and using Wi-Fi for data transmissions is that Wi-Fi transmissions are not charged against your cellular data subscription
plan. Also, Wi-Fi is generally faster than most cellular connections. (When you disable cellular data, you can still send SMS
texts because these texts use the carrier’s network and not the Internet.) Disabling roaming can prevent roaming charges
on your bill incurred from using other carriers’ cellular networks when you travel outside your home territory.
To disable roaming on an Android device, go to the Network & internet menu in the Settings app, tap Mobile
network, and then disable Roaming. On an iOS device, open the Settings app, tap Cellular (see Figure 9-16A), and
turn off Cellular Data. Next, tap Cellular Data Options, and then turn off roaming. On the Cellular Data Options
screen, you can also turn on Low Data Mode to conserve cellular data usage. See Figure 9-16B.
Applying Concepts
Figure 9-16 Control (A) data usages and (B) data
roaming in iOS
(A) (B)
If you have roaming enabled,
especially for a CDMA device,
you’ll want to keep the Preferred
Roaming List (PRL) updated.
The PRL is a database file that
lists the preferred service providers or radio frequencies your carrier wants the device to use when
outside your home network. To
update the PRL, follow instructions
from your carrier. For example, for
Verizon, you dial *228, and select
2 to update your PRL. When the
update completes, a message
appears on your phone. For an
Android phone, you then need to
power down the device and turn
it back on.
Like desktop computers, a mobile device can be configured to communicate information securely over a virtual private
network (VPN) connection. To create a VPN connection, in the Android Settings app, tap Connections, More connection
settings, and VPN. In iOS Settings, tap General, VPN. To set up the VPN, you’ll need to know the type of encryption
protocol used (IKEv2, IPsec, or L2TP), the IP address or domain name of the VPN server, and the user name and password to the corporate network. Figure 9-17 shows the configuration options on an iOS smartphone. Also, Google offers
a VPN connection for Android devices using the Google One mobile app when you subscribe to Google cloud storage.

Location Services
Core 1 Objective 1.4
Many mobile apps, such as Google Maps, require a location service to work. The
following are two services a mobile device might use:
●● GPS. A GPS (Global Positioning System) feature is embedded in smartphones, smart watches, tablets, some automobiles, and even some
medical devices, making it possible to identify the device’s location
in relation to multiple satellites in orbit around the Earth. GPS data is
never sent to these satellites; the device receives the data to determine
its location. However, the device might send GPS location data to Apple
or Google.
●● Cellular location service. A mobile device can also determine its location from Bluetooth, crowd-sourced Wi-Fi, and cellular databases. These
databases are built from geotagged locations of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell
towers using anonymous and encrypted data sent from devices.
Location services are managed by Apple for iOS and iPadOS and by Google
for Android. Using the Settings app, you can turn off location services and decide
how apps can use the service. However, know that Apple or Google still has the
right to locate your device—for example, when you place an emergency phone
call or to enhance their crowd-sourced location database—even if location services is turned off.
To manage the location services on an Android device, in the Settings app,
tap Location. See Figure 9-18A. To change the way apps can use location services,
tap App access to location (see Figure 9-18B). For Apple devices, in the Settings
app, tap Privacy and Location Services to turn the service on or off.

PAN Connections
Core 1 Objectives 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2.3
Mobile devices typically have the capability to connect to other nearby wireless devices and accessories using a
Bluetooth or NFC wireless connection:
●● Bluetooth. Bluetooth is a short-range (about 30 feet or 10 meters) wireless technology used to connect two
devices in a small PAN. To create a Bluetooth connection, the two devices must be paired, a process you’ll
learn more about later in this module. Figure 9-19 shows a smartphone connected to a Bluetooth speaker.
●● NFC. Near-field communication (NFC) is a wireless technology that establishes a communication link
between two NFC devices that are within 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) of each other. For example, an NFC
tag (see Figure 9-20) contains a small microchip that can be embedded in just about anything, including a
key chain tag, printed flyer, or billboard. The NFC tag dispenses information to any NFC-enabled smartphone
or other device that comes within 4 inches of the tag.
Figure 9-20 These programmable NFC tags
have sticky backs for attaching
to a flat surface such as a wall,
desk, or car dashboard
Figure 9-21 Use NFC wireless with an iPhone to
create a contactless payment
Prykhodov/Dreamstime.com
NFC is a form of RFID; they both operate near the 13.56 MHz radio frequency. RFID (radio-frequency identification) is
traditionally used in small tags that attach to and identify clothing inventory, car keys, bags, luggage, pets, cattle, hospital
patients, and much more. An RFID tag contains a microchip and antenna and can be a passive or active tag. Active RFID tags
have built-in batteries and transmitters to respond to commands or requests for information. Passive RFID tags, which cost
much less, are essentially electronic barcodes that can be read from a few feet away without requiring line-of-sight access.
NFC operates at a slightly higher frequency than RFID, and its range is shorter, which makes it more secure. For
example, two iPhones must be very close to each other for NFC to work. Although NFC can read RFID tags, a mobile
device does not communicate peer-to-peer with RFID devices.
Contactless Payments
Credit card transactions processed using Apple Pay or
Google Pay use NFC when the device comes close to a
point-of-sale terminal. The transaction uses two-factor
authentication (2FA), which means two actions are needed
to authenticate the payer. Biometric authentication can
include a fingerprint or facial recognition. For example,
when your iPhone comes near a point-of-sale terminal (see
Figure 9-21), and you enter a passcode or PIN to access
your phone, Apple Pay displays the payment amount on
your phone for you to accept. You can then use FaceID
or Touch ID to authenticate your face or fingerprint to
complete the transaction.

Near-Field Privacy
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and NFC technologies can be used to share data between
two devices when they are in close range. To protect your privacy and
secure the data on your device, you can manage this near-field scanner
feature as follows:
●● Android Nearby Share. On an Android device, in the Settings app,
tap Google, Devices & sharing, and Nearby Share (see Figure 9-22).
To control which contacts can be shared, tap Device visibility. You
can share or hide all contacts or share just a few. When notifications
are turned on, you will be notified when another device is scanning
for a near-field connection.
●● iOS and iPadOS AirDrop. AirDrop is an Apple wireless standard
that uses both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to provide near-field (within 30
feet) data transfers between iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple
devices. (AirDrop won’t share with an Android device.) To manage
AirDrop, swipe down from the upper-right corner of the screen to
open the Control Center (see Figure 9-23A), press and hold the topleft group of controls, and tap the AirDrop icon (see Figure 9-23B).
Then you can decide to turn AirDrop on or off and decide to share
an item only with your contacts or with everyone. (You can also
control AirDrop settings in the Settings app under General.) To
share a selected item, tap the Share icon, and then tap AirDrop in
the list of ways to share the item.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to be able to contrast and compare Bluetooth, NFC, and RFID. You also need to know
how to make a Bluetooth connection and understand what two-factor authentication is.

Pairing Bluetooth Devices
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 1.3
To configure a Bluetooth connection, complete the following steps:
1. Turn on the Bluetooth device—such as a speaker,
headset, webcam, or keyboard—to which you want
to connect your mobile device.
2. Enable Bluetooth on the device and enable pairing
mode. Sometimes just turning on Bluetooth
enables pairing automatically for a limited period
of time. The device might have a pairing button or
combination of buttons to enable pairing and a light
that blinks to indicate the device is ready to receive
a Bluetooth connection. This makes the device
discoverable, which means it’s transmitting a signal
to identify itself to nearby Bluetooth devices.
3. On your mobile device, turn on Bluetooth. The
mobile device searches for Bluetooth devices. If it
discovers the Bluetooth device (see Figure 9-24), tap
it to connect. The two Bluetooth devices now begin
the pairing process. Some Bluetooth devices might
require a code to connect. For example, when an
iPad and Bluetooth keyboard are pairing, the iPad
displays a four-digit code that must be entered on
the keyboard.
4. Test the connection. For an audio device, play a
video or audio recording on the mobile device, and
for a keyboard, type into a notes application or text
box.
Applying Concepts
Figure 9-24 Tap to connect the iPhone to

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to pair Bluetooth devices and then test connectivity after the connection is established.
You can automatically disable a mobile device antenna that transmits signals by enabling airplane mode so that the
device can neither transmit nor receive the signals. Many newer devices do not disable the GPS or NFC antennas; GPS
only receives and never transmits, and NFC signals don’t reach very far. While airplane mode is on, you can manually
enable some wireless connections, such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

Mobile Device Ports and Accessories
Core 1 Objective 1.3
You can buy all kinds of mobile device accessories, such as wireless keyboards, touch pens,
speakers, webcams, earbuds, headsets, game
pads, docking stations, printers, extra battery
packs and chargers, USB adapters, memory
cards (usually the microSD form factor) to
expand storage space, credit card readers for
accepting payments by credit card, and protective covers for waterproofing. For example,
Figure 9-25 shows a Bluetooth headset.
When buying accessories for a mobile
device, be sure to check what ports and slots
are available on the device. For example, many
mobile devices no longer include replaceable
batteries. Current iPhones no longer have
audio ports—to use a wired headset, you have
to plug a dongle into the Lightning port. Some
mobile devices have a slot for a memory card,
which might be located on the side of the case
or inside it; however, Apple mobile devices and
many others don’t offer this feature. Figure 9-26
shows a memory card slot on an Android tablet,
and Figure 9-27 shows a MicroSD card.
Figure 9-26 An Android device might provide a memory card slot to

Wired Connections for Accessories
Smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices can make a wired connection to a computer. This connection can be
used to charge the device, download software updates, upload data to the computer, back up data, and restore
software or data. The device’s port used for power and communication may be a type of USB (Universal Serial Bus)
port or a proprietary, vendor-specific port. Some USB connectors used for this purpose include microUSB (see
Figure 9-28A), the smaller miniUSB (see Figure 9-28B), and the newer USB-C (see Figure 9-28C). USB-C is the first
USB connector that can plug into a port in either orientation. Apple iPhones, iPods, and iPads use the proprietary
Lightning port and connector for power and communication (see Figure 9-29). Some newer iPads use the USB-C
connector.

port adapter cables when you need to connect
your tablet to a Linux server in a server room.
(A server is likely to provide a serial port for
that purpose.) See Figure 9-30.

Mobile Apps for Business Use
Core 1 Objectives 1.4, 4.1
In this section of the module, you learn how to support mobile devices that are used for corporate and business
needs, including configuring corporate email and synchronizing devices for email and other corporate applications.
Mobile Devices Managed by Corporate Policies
Core 1 Objective 1.4
Corporations and schools might provide corporate-owned devices, which are secured and managed by corporate policies and procedures, and/or the organization might have BYOD (bring your own device) policies and
procedures. With BYOD, an employee or student is allowed to connect their own device to the organization’s
network. For security purposes, an organization configures the person’s device before allowing it to connect to
the network.
Large corporations use mobile device management (MDM) software that provides tools for securing and tracking mobile devices—even when they’re turned off—and managing the data on those devices. Examples of MDM
software suites include Verizon MDM, Apple MDM for Apple products, Scalefusion for Android devices, and Microsoft
Endpoint Manager. MDM policies typically include the following:
●● Security policy enforcement, such as applying patches, enforcing password requirements, and requiring
two-factor authentication
●● Data encryption requirements, to protect data on the mobile device if it falls into the wrong hands, and
synchronization of that data to cloud storage for backups
●● Remote lock-and-wipe capabilities, to lock down a device and erase all data on it
●● Restrictions on the use of unsecured apps
To do all this, MDM installs a small app called an agent on a managed mobile device, which communicates
through various Wi-Fi or cellular connections back to the MDM server in the company data center. The initial installing of the agent and the agent checking the device for security compliance is called on-boarding. The reverse process
when the mobile device is removed from the MDM fleet is called off-boarding.
When a corporation needs to keep financial, regulated, or other sensitive data on an employee’s personal device,
it might choose to enhance MDM with software that specifically targets protecting corporate apps and their data.
Mobile application management (MAM) software serves that purpose by the following processes:
●● Separating corporate data and apps from personal data and apps on a device, which is called sandboxing
these corporate assets.
●● Assuring that corporate data is only transmitted over a secure and encrypted connection, called a VPN
(Virtual Private Network). The data is encrypted when it is at rest on the device and in transit.
●● Managing and updating corporate applications remotely.
When MAM is protecting corporate data and apps, the user normally has more freedom to install their own
personal apps and data on their device. MAM software is sometimes a part of MDM software, and it can also be a
standalone product that works in addition to MDM software.
Configure Mobile Device Email
Core 1 Objective 1.4
Android has its Gmail app, and iOS has its Mail app; either app can work with any email provider. Rather than using
OS embedded mail apps, you can install your own. For example, Blue Mail or Spark are free open-source mail apps,
and Polymail (polymail.io) and Microsoft Outlook (Microsoft.com) are paid-for commercial mail apps.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
To configure email in iOS, use the Settings app. In Settings,
tap Mail, Accounts, and Add Account. A list of popular email
providers appears (see Figure 9-32). If your provider is not in
the list, tap Other and enter the requested information to set up
email, contacts, and calendars. For Android, tap the Gmail app,
and then tap Add an email address.
Here is the information you’ll need to configure an email app
on a mobile device:
●● Your email address and password. For iOS, iPadOS, and
Android, if your email account is with Google, Microsoft
Exchange, Outlook, Yahoo!, or AOL (iPhone and iPad only),
your email address and password are all you need because
the OS can automatically set up these accounts. If you are
setting up a work account that uses Microsoft 365 for business, don’t use the Outlook option, but rather check with
your administrator for server settings.
When configuring corporate email addresses, messages
such as that shown in Figure 9-31 might appear asking for
permission to apply extra security to the device.
Note 9 Figure 9-31 Corporate email services
might require extra security
on a device
Figure 9-32 When setting up email in iOS,
select an email provider
Microsoft Exchange is a private enterprise email service
that is hosted on corporation or ISP servers to provide
company email addresses and includes email, calendars,
and contacts services. It can integrate with MDM software
suites to enforce MDM policies on mobile devices.
Note 10
If your email account is with any other provider, you’ll also
need the following information:
●● Names of your incoming and outgoing email servers. To find this information, check the support page of
your email provider’s website. For example, the server
you use for incoming mail might be imap.mycompany.
com, and the server you use for outgoing mail might be
smtp.mycompany.com. The  two servers might have the
same name.
●● Type of protocol your incoming server uses. The incoming server uses IMAP4 or POP3. With IMAP4, you are
managing your email on the server. For example, you can
move a message from one folder to another on your device,
which causes that change to happen on the remote server.
Using POP3, the messages are downloaded to your device,
where you manage them locally. Most POP3 mail servers
give you the option to leave the messages on the server or
delete them after they are downloaded.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Security used. Most likely, if email is encrypted
during transmission, the configuration will happen
automatically, without your involvement. However,
if you have problems, you need to be aware of these
possible settings for the incoming server:
■ An IMAP server uses port 143 unless it is
secured and using SSL/TLS, which uses
port 993.
■ A POP3 server uses port 110 unless it is secured
and using SSL/TLS, which uses port 995 (see
Figure 9-33).
●● Outgoing server. Previously, outgoing email was
sent using the SMTP protocol, which uses port 25.
Now, most SMTP servers support secure SMTP,
which uses TLS encryption for sending messages
and port 587 or 2525 as an alternative port.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about POP3, IMAP, SMTP, and the ports they use, and it might require you
to use this information in configuring email on a mobile device. Before you sit for the exam, memorize the protocols
and ports discussed in this section, and understand how this information is used to configure email on a mobile device.
A project at the end of this module will give you practice with this process.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to describe the functions of ActiveSync in Microsoft Exchange.
Figure 9-33 A POP3 email server might use
SSL/TLS encryption and port 995
When setting up corporate email that uses Microsoft Exchange, know that the Exchange server can control how
the email service works on a mobile device based on MDM policies. These policies can include how email, calendars,
contacts, and tasks are synced between the server and the device. Within Exchange, ActiveSync is responsible for
syncing data between the server and device. If ActiveSync is disabled at the server end, no Exchange data is synced,
which means no data is kept on the device, and, therefore, it is not available to the user when the mobile device
is offline (not connected to the Internet). In addition, ActiveSync can perform remote wipes and enforce password
policies and data encryption.
Mobile Device Synchronization
Core 1 Objectives 1.4, 4.1
In this section of the module, you learn to use a Google or Apple account to sync or mirror data among your devices
and the cloud. For example, a photo taken, new contact added, or calendar event created on one device is available
in the cloud and on all other devices. As another example, when you sync email, the email app on your phone shows
the same email messages as the browser or email client on your desktop computer.

Google Syncing
All data that Google keeps under your account at google.com can be synced with your Android devices. In the Google
cloud, the first 15 GB of cloud storage is free. With Android devices, to manage what is synced, open the Settings
app, tap Google and Backup (see Figure 9-34A). Then tap Google Account data. On the Account sync screen (see
Figure 9-34B), turn on or off syncing for each type of Google account data. To sync now, tap the three-dot icon in the
upper-right corner of the screen, and tap Sync now.

Caution
It’s not safe to store passwords in your browser. It’s much more secure to use a password manager app, such as
KeePass (keepass.info) or LastPass (lastpass.com). KeePass stores passwords only on the local computer, which is more
secure but less convenient. LastPass can store passwords in the cloud and sync passwords across devices, which is
more convenient but less secure.
You can choose whether to sync only over Wi-Fi so that syncing doesn’t use up your cellular data caps. On the
Backup screen, shown in Figure 9-34A, turn on or off Back up using mobile data.
You can also control additional sync settings in the Settings app and in individual apps:
●● Contacts syncing. Use the Settings app to sync Contacts:
1. Open the Settings app, tap Google, Settings for Google apps, and Google Contacts sync. Notice in
Figure 9-35A that Google contacts are syncing. To change this setting, tap Manage settings under
Status. On the next screen, you can turn syncing off and on (see Figure 9-35B).

way Google handles non-Google contacts, as shown in Figure 9-35B.
●● Photo syncing. Use the Photo app to manage photo syncing:
1. Open the Photo app, and tap the account profile icon (your photo) in the upper-right corner. Then
tap Photos settings and Back up & sync (see Figure 9-36A). Using this screen, you can turn on and off
photo syncing.
2. To manage how cellular data is used for photo syncing, tap Cell data usage (see Figure 9-36B).
To access your content in the cloud, use a browser on any computer to go to google.com and sign in
to your Google account. A single sign-on (SSO) for multiple services gives access to Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, Contacts, Photos, and other content. Click the Google apps icon to select different apps, as shown in
Figure 9-37. When you select an app, such as Contacts or Calendar, the content in that app displays. You can
also go directly to the Google content using direct links, such as contacts.google.com, photos.google.com, and
calendar.google.com.
For a monthly fee, you can subscribe to Google Workspace Individual, which offers enhanced versions of Google
Meet (a video conferencing tool), Google Calendar, and Gmail. Google Workspace for an organization is managed via
an Admin console where you can add new users, migrate user content, and manage cloud storage and file sharing.

Apple Syncing
iOS and iPadOS sync content to the Apple website at icloud.com; the first 5 GB of cloud storage is free. Here is what
you need to know about Apple syncing:
●● Manage what is synced. To set up iCloud syncing, go to the Settings app on your iPad or iPhone, tap the
user name, and tap iCloud to go to the screen (see Figure 9-38) where you can manage your iCloud storage
and decide which apps and data get synced (including contacts and calendars).
●● Manage cellular data used for syncing. In the Settings app, tap Wi-Fi (see Figure 9-39A), and then tap the
Info icon beside the current Wi-Fi connection. On the next screen (see Figure 9-39B), the Low Data Mode
can be turned on or off to control how cellular data is used. When Low Data Mode is on, automatic updates
and data syncing is paused unless there is a Wi-Fi connection.
●● Manage content in iCloud. You can access synced data in the cloud from your computer by signing in to your
Apple account at icloud.com. Figure 9-40 shows the home page for your iCloud content, including Mail, Contacts,
Calendar, iCloud Drive, and location data, among others. Click an item to drill down into its content.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know how to manage contact and calendar syncing in Android and Apple devices.

Microsoft 365, OneDrive, and SharePoint
Third-party apps and services can also be used to sync data. One example is Microsoft 365, previously called Office
365, which is a suite of productivity apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Visio. A subscription to
Microsoft 365 includes 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage (onedrive.live.com). Microsoft 365 installs on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones and syncs data to OneDrive on multiple devices and in the cloud. When setting up
a Microsoft 365 account for business, ask your administrator for the correct server settings for the account. Teams
can collaborate with documents stored in OneDrive, or an individual user can share a document on OneDrive with
anyone with a Microsoft account. OneDrive works well for syncing data for an individual or a few team members.
SharePoint also provides cloud storage that integrates with Microsoft 365 but goes further than OneDrive as powerful content collaboration and management software in an enterprise.

Troubleshooting Mobile Devices
Core 1 Objective 5.5
As an IT support technician for mobile devices, know that they contain few field replaceable units (FRU), or hardware that can be replaced by field technicians. The cost of repairing the device—including parts, special tools, and
labor—generally exceeds the value of replacing the device. Although it is possible to replace the screens in some
mobile devices, a support technician is generally not expected to take the time to do so.
There are, however, many problems with a device that you can troubleshoot using tools within the OS. When
learning to troubleshoot any OS or device, remember the web is a great source of information. Depend on the
support.google.com/android and support.apple.com websites to give you troubleshooting tips and procedures for their
respective operating systems and mobile devices. For Android devices, also look for help on the device manufacturer
website. Let’s start with exploring the tools you need to troubleshoot mobile devices.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know about mobile device synchronization with Microsoft 365.

Troubleshooting Techniques
Core 1 Objective 5.5
The following steps are ordered to solve a problem while making the least changes to the system (i.e., try the least
invasive solution first). Try the first step; if it does not solve the problem, move on to the next step. With each step,
first make sure the device is plugged in or already has sufficient charge to complete the step. After you try one step,
check to see if the problem is solved before you move on to the next step. Here are the general steps we’re following,
although some might not be possible, depending on the situation:
1. Close, uninstall, and reinstall an app. Too many open apps can shorten battery life and slow down
device performance. If you suspect an app is causing a problem, uninstall it and use the app store to
reinstall it.
2. Use the Settings app to update the OS.
3. Restart the device (also called a soft boot) and reboot the device (also called a hard boot). This step is
covered in more depth in the following section.
Restart or Reboot the Device
A restart powers down the device and restarts it, which is similar
to a Windows restart. A reboot, also called a hard boot, is similar
to a Windows shutdown and performs a full clean boot. First try a
restart, and if that doesn’t fix the problem, try a hard boot:
1. Restart the device, also called a soft boot. To restart an
Android device, press and hold the power button, and
select Restart (see Figure 9-41). To restart an iPhone or
iPad, press and hold the side or top button, and slide
the power-off message to the right. To turn the device
back on, press and hold the Android power button or
the iPhone or iPad side or top button. Power cycling a
smartphone every few days is a good idea to keep the
phone functioning at peak efficiency.
2. Reboot the device using a hard boot. When the menus
in a device don’t work or the device freezes entirely, a
full clean boot might help. For most Android devices,
hold down the power button to see the menu shown in
Figure 9-41, and tap Power off twice. If that doesn’t work,
try holding down the power button and the volumedown button at the same time. (Check Android device
manufacturers for details.) To reboot an iPhone or iPad,
hold down the side or top button and the volume-down
button at the same time until the Apple logo appears.
(For older iPhones and iPads, press and hold the side or
top button and the Home button.)
If the device has a removable battery and it refuses to hard
boot, you can open the back of the device and then remove and
reinstall the battery as a last resort (unless the device is under
warranty).
In the module “Mobile Device Security,” you learn more troubleshooting techniques to solve mobile device problems, including
how to repair and reinstall the OS, perform a factory reset, and
recover the system.

Common Mobile Device Malware Symptoms
Core 1 Objective 5.5
Android mobile devices are more susceptible to malware than iPhones and iPads because apps can be downloaded
from sites other than Google. With iOS and iPadOS, apps can be obtained only from the Apple App Store and are
therefore more strictly vetted. However, for any mobile device, malware can be introduced by a Trojan that a user
accepts (for example, as an email attachment) or by macros embedded in shared documents.
Here are some symptoms that indicate malware might be at work on an Android, iOS, or iPadOS device:
●● Power drain, sluggish response time, slow data speeds, high network traffic, high number of ads, datausage limit notification, limited or no Internet connectivity. All these symptoms can indicate that apps
are running in the background—draining resources and leaking your data to online servers. For example,
when the XAgent malware app installs on an Apple device with iOS version 7 or older, the app icon is hidden, and the app runs in the background. When you close the app, it restarts. The malware not only uses
resources; it also steals personal data and makes screenshots, which it sends to a remote command-andcontrol (C&C) server.
●● Fake security warnings, unexpected app behavior, and strange text messages. A C&C server might send
coded text messages back to the phone. If you receive strange text messages, suspect malware. Fake security
warnings can bait you into installing an app, which is actually more malware, to clean the system
●● Dropped phone calls or weak signal. Dropped phone calls can be caused by a weak signal, which can be
resolved by moving to a place where cellular coverage is stronger. However, dropped phone calls can also
happen when malware is interfering and trying to eavesdrop on your conversations or is performing other
background activities.
●● Unintended Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections. Malicious Wi-Fi hotspots and Bluetooth devices can hijack
a device or inject it with malware. When a mobile device connects to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot, the device
can receive a malicious script that repeatedly reboots the device, which makes it unusable. To prevent this
type of attack, avoid free Wi-Fi hotspots or use a VPN connection. To prevent a device from pairing with a
malicious Bluetooth device, turn off Bluetooth when it’s not in use.
●● Unauthorized account access or leaked personal files or data. A malicious app can steal passwords
and data from other apps and can pretend to be a different app to get access to online accounts. If you
suspect an online account has been hacked, consider malware might be on the mobile device that uses
this account.
●● Unauthorized use of camera or microphone. Unauthorized surveillance is a sure sign of malware. Stalker
spyware apps have been known to take photos and send them to a C&C server; send a text alert to a hacker
and then add the hacker to a live call; use the microphone to record live conversations and then send the
recording to a C&C server; report Facebook, and iMessage activity, including passwords and location data;
and upload all photos, videos, and text messages to a C&C server.
When is spyware legal? Parents can legally install spyware (politely called monitoring software) on a minor child’s phone,
tablet, or computer, and employers can monitor employee devices when they are company owned. One example of a
spyware app is FlexiSPY (flexispy.com), an app that runs in the background to monitor text, email, Facebook and other
visited websites, apps, photos, videos, contacts, bookmarks, location tracking, and phone calls. It can also record calls
and surrounding sounds. It comes with a mobile viewer app installed on the parent’s or employer’s smartphone.

Mobile Device Malware Removal
Core 1 Objective 5.5
Here are general steps for removing malware from a mobile
device, listed from least to most invasive:
●● Uninstall the offending app. If you can identify the
malware app, close the app and uninstall it. If the app
won’t uninstall, force stop the app or any background
processes that belong to the app. Then try again to
uninstall the app.
●● Update the OS. Check to see if any updates are available for the device.
●● Perform a factory reset. The most surefire way to
remove malware is to back up data and other content,
reset the device to its factory default state, and then
restore the content from backup. How to perform a
factory reset is covered in the module “Mobile Device
Security.”
After you have removed malware on a mobile device,
you will want to keep it clean. Here are a few tips:
●● Keep OS updates current.
●● Educate users about the importance of privacy settings (for example, disable cookies, and turn off
Bluetooth when it’s not in use). Also, users should
not open email attachments or download shared files
from untrusted sources.
●● Consider installing an anti-malware app. Search online
reviews, and consider the features offered before
deciding on an anti-malware app. An anti-malware
app, such as Avast shown in Figure 9-42, can scan
apps and files for malware, scan for unauthorized surveillance, monitor security and privacy settings, find
the device when it’s lost, lock and remote wipe it, and
maintain automatic updates. It might even include a
firewall or a VPN feature.

Other Common Problems and Solutions
Core 1 Objective 5.5
Several common problems with mobile devices can be addressed with a little understanding of what may have gone
wrong behind the scenes. Here’s a description of how to handle some common problems:
Display and Touchscreen Issues
Problems with the display and touchscreen might include the following:
●● Malfunctioning touch response. Most smartphones today never
need touch screen calibration, which is realigning the screen
to touch. However, for Android, you can download and install
the free Touchscreen Calibration app. There is no such app for
an iPhone or iPad. If you think calibration is needed on these
devices, Apple recommends you first try rebooting the device. If
that doesn’t work, go to Settings, and reset all settings. The next
step is to take the phone to an Apple service center for repair.
Here are some general tips to try when a touch screen is
giving you problems:
■ Clean the screen with a soft, lint-free cloth.
■ Don’t use the touch screen when your hands are wet or you
are wearing gloves.
■ Restart the device.
■ Remove any plastic sheet or film protecting the touch
screen. Some screen protectors are too thick and interfere
with the touch screen interface. Bubbles and debris under
the screen protector can also cause problems. Use a screen
protector that is approved for your device, and carefully
follow instructions for installing it. Turn on the screen
protector’s touch sensitivity setting if available.
■ If you recently installed a third-party app when the touch
screen became unresponsive, try uninstalling the app.
■ Sometimes touch response and displays are affected by
settings on the accessibility menu in the Settings app (for
Android, see Figure 9-43).
●● Digitizer issues. A mobile device screen contains three layers:
a thin layer of glass, a digitizer, and the LCD screen that displays the graphical interface. The digitizer, also called a touch
screen, is an electrical sheet just under the glass that turns a
tap or swipe into digital data transmitted to the OS. The digitizer is often fused to the LCD component. When the digitizer
stops working, touch does not work, and it’s time to replace the
digitizer. When you repair a device’s screen, in most situations,
you replace the entire screen—including the glass, digitizer, and
LCD—as one component.
●● Broken screen. If you can still use the device, first transfer all the data and settings to your computer or
the cloud. How to do that is covered in the module “Mobile Device Security.” If the device is under warranty, follow the warranty holder’s directions for repairs or replacement. Alternately, you can take the
device to a repair center or replace the screen yourself. For most mobile devices, you can find teardown
instructions, videos, tools, and replacement parts for purchase online at various websites, such as ifixit.

Connectivity Issues
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and Apple AirDrop connections may experience connectivity issues, such as those described
here:
●● Bluetooth connectivity issues. Turn the Bluetooth radio off and then back on again. Devices typically limit
the time they’re available for pairing, so reactivating Bluetooth restarts the pairing process. In Bluetooth
settings, you might be able to adjust the visibility timeout so devices have more time to discover each other.
You can also delete all known Bluetooth devices in the Settings app to try the pairing process from the beginning. Sometimes an OS update will cause issues with Wi-Fi network connectivity or Bluetooth pairings. In
this case, reset network settings in the Settings app. This restores network settings to factory defaults, and
then you can attempt pairing again.
●● Wi-Fi connectivity problems. Intermittent connectivity problems or no wireless connectivity might be
caused by problems with the signal that is being broadcast from the router or access point. First make sure
the access point and router are working correctly, that they’re positioned closely enough to each other and
the device, that the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to is visible to the device (not hidden), and that
Figure 9-44 At ifixit.com, you can find instructions and purchase tools or parts to replace an

Caution
Be sure to check out a cell phone repair (CPR) shop before you trust it with your device. Although there are many
trustworthy businesses, some have been known to trade expensive parts inside a phone for cheap plastic ones while
they perform a repair. In addition, the quality of the replacement components contributes to the success of the repair.

you’re using the correct security key. For Wi-Fi issues on
the device side, first start with Wi-Fi settings in the Settings app for the network to which you’re trying to connect. Try renewing the IP address, and if that doesn’t work,
tell the device to forget the network (see Figure 9-45), and
then retry connecting to the network. Finally, try resetting
the network settings. By default, many mobile devices stop
attempting to reconnect to a weak Wi-Fi signal to conserve
battery power, but you can sometimes change this setting
so the device will attempt to maintain a connection even
with a weak signal.
●● Near-field communication (NFC) issues. NFC range
between devices should be less than eight inches. Verify
the battery has at least a 75% charge and the OS is up
to date. Try removing the device cover, which might be
hindering a good wireless connection. With Android, to
resolve NFC issues, try updating the Google Pay app. If
you are trying to pay using a manufacturer’s pay app, such
as Samsung Pay, try updating the app, erasing data in the
app, forcing the app to close, and then reopening the app.
If NFC issues began immediately after an OS update, try
a hard boot, which usually fixes an NFC issue after an OS
update. If problems persist, consider a factory reset and
restore from backup.
●● AirDrop connectivity issues. AirDrop uses Bluetooth to
find other Apple devices to connect with and then uses a
peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connection to transmit files. Because of Bluetooth limits, the devices must be within a
30-foot range. For AirDrop to work, both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios must be turned on. To make the initial
contact, both devices must be awake and AirDrop turned on and discoverable. To allow a Mac computer to
be discovered by AirDrop, in the Finder window, select AirDrop in the left pane, and select an option in the
right pane (see Figure 9-46). If you still have difficulty connecting, try turning AirDrop off and back on. To
use the connection, select items to share, and then tap the share icon (see Figure 9-47).

Damaged Ports and Liquid Damage
Physical damage to ports can include the following:
●● Physically damaged port. Android devices
might use a microUSB or USB-C port, and
Apple devices use a Lightning port. Their
connectors are shown earlier, in Figures 9-28
and 9-29. If a port is not working, try blowing
out the port with compressed air. Dust or
lint may be stuck in the port. Using a toothpick or needle to clean out a port is not
recommended.
●● Water or other liquid damage. When you
connect a cable to an iPhone or iPad Lightning port and the device detects liquid
in the port, it displays a Liquid Detected
alert. Charging is not available, and accessories using the port won’t connect. For any
mobile device, don’t use the port until it’s
completely dry. Tap your phone gently to
shake out excess liquid. Put it in a dry place,
in front of a cool fan. Wait at least 30 minutes
before trying the port again. Don’t use heat
or compressed air to dry your device. For
Android devices that are not under warranty,
remove the battery to speed up drying.
In an emergency, you might need to use or charge your phone even if it’s wet. In this situation, Apple recommends
you dismiss the Liquid Detected alert and try charging your phone anyway or use a wireless charger. Although recommended on many websites, Apple says not to put your device in a bag of rice to dry it out.

Battery, Overheating, and Charging Issues
Problems with the battery can include the following:
●● Improper charging. A device charging slowly or not charging at all might be caused by a loose connection
between the device and charging cable or electrical outlet, a damaged port the charger is used, or the electrical outlet. Do the simple things first: check the cable connections, and verify the electrical outlet is working.
Try cleaning the port and exchanging the charging cable. Make sure the device is not overheating; when a
device gets too hot, charging will stop. Try restarting and rebooting your device. Can you replace the battery?
●● Poor battery health. Too many apps or malware running in the background will drain the battery quickly,
as will Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other wireless technologies. Disable wireless connections and close apps when
you’re not using them to save battery juice. Consider that malware might be at work. If the battery charge
still lasts an extremely short time, try exchanging the charging cable. If that doesn’t work, exchange the battery unless the device is under warranty. Many Android devices have replaceable batteries, so if a battery
is performing poorly, consider replacing it. Try searching the ifixit.com website on the device brand and
model to see how complicated it is to replace the battery and the cost of a new battery.
●● Overheating or swollen battery. For a true overheating problem where the device is too hot to touch safely,
power off and replace the device. However, all devices can get fairly warm if the display is left on for too
long, if the surrounding environment is particularly hot, if the device is sitting on a blanket or other soft

surface, if the case is not properly vented, if the battery is going bad, or if the device remains plugged in
to a power source for a long period of time. Don’t use a mobile device for too long in direct sunlight, turn
off the display when you’re not using it, and close apps that you’re not using. This will also help conserve
battery power. Also, using the device as a mobile hotspot can stress the battery and cause it to overheat.
If you know where the battery is located inside a mobile device, check for heat originating from that area of the
device. If the area is hot, replacing the battery might be your solution. First check if the phone is under warranty. If
the phone is not under warranty, open the case, and examine the battery for damage. Is it swollen or warped? If so,
replace the battery. If the phone is under warranty, do not open it. Instead, see if you can tell if the battery is swollen
or warped by laying the phone on a flat surface. If the phone itself appears warped, take it in for repair.
Some Android smartphones provide information about the device when you enter *#*#4636#*#* in the phone’s dialer
keypad. In the screen that appears, select Battery Information. If the Battery Health screen reports “unknown,” suspect
a bad battery. The screen also reports the temperature of the battery, which should be less than 40°C.

Mobile Devices, Operating Systems, Connections, and Accessories
●● An IT support technician might be called on to service mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets,
and, therefore, needs to know the basics of using and supporting Android, iOS, and iPadOS mobile operating systems.
●● A mobile device might have several antennas for wireless connections—primarily Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth,
NFC, and cellular. The device uses a Wi-Fi or cellular antenna to connect to a LAN (local area network), a
WAN (wide area network), or to create its own hotspot, and it uses Bluetooth or NFC to connect to a PAN
(personal area network). A wired connection might use a microUSB, miniUSB, USB-C, or proprietary port,
such as the Lightning port by Apple, for syncing with a computer or tethering to provide the computer with
cellular WAN access.
Mobile Apps for Business Use
●● Large corporations use mobile device management (MDM) software on mobile devices to secure and back
up their content on the device. Mobile application management (MAM) software enhances MDM by providing additional protection for corporate apps and data.
●● Email can be accessed on a mobile device through an email client embedded in the mobile OS or through
third-party commercial mail apps. Microsoft Exchange is a private enterprise email service that is hosted
on corporation or ISP servers.
●● Syncing mirrors app data and other content among your devices and the cloud. Apple and Google both
offer syncing that is linked to your Apple or Google account. In addition, Microsoft offers Microsoft 365 and
OneDrive or SharePoint syncing as do other software and cloud providers.
Troubleshooting Mobile Devices
●● To troubleshoot a mobile device using tools in the OS, you can close running apps, uninstall and reinstall
an app, update the OS, and restart and reboot the device.
●● Common problems a technician might face when supporting mobile devices include malware, malfunctioning touch response, digitizer issues, a broken screen, connectivity issues, damaged ports, liquid damage,
improper charging, poor battery health, overheating, and a swollen battery.

Configuring Email on a Mobile Device
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 1.4
For this project, use an Android device and an email account that you have not already set up on the device. If you
don’t already have an email account you can use, you can create a free one using mail.google.com, outlook.live.com,
or mail.yahoo.com.
Follow these steps to manually configure the email client on an Android device:
1. Open the Gmail app. If an email address is already set up, tap the account profile photo, and tap Add
another account. If this is the first email setup, tap Add an email address. Gmail can automatically
configure email from many providers. Because it’s essential that you know how to manually configure email
on a mobile device, tap Other.
2. Add your email address and tap MANUAL SETUP. Check with your email provider to determine whether to
use POP3 or IMAP. What is the main difference between these two protocols? What are the ports for these
two protocols? What are the secure ports for these protocols?
3. Enter the password and click NEXT. On the Incoming server settings screen, verify the incoming server
name, and, for POP3, decide when you want to delete mail on the server, and click NEXT. If the OS needs
more direction for security settings, you might need to tell it which security protocol the email provider
uses. Options are STARTTLS, SSL/TLS, and None.

Introduction
This module explores in depth the most popular types of printers and how to support them. As you work through
the module, you learn about printer types and features, how to install a local or network printer, and how to share
a printer with others on a network. You learn how to manage printer features, add-on devices, shared printers, and
print jobs. Finally, you learn about maintaining and troubleshooting printers.
Printer Types and Features
Core 1 Objectives 3.6, 3.7
Printers come in many different types with varying features and are chosen by the production needs of users. Printers are capable of printing anything from a simple document to an entire building. Commonly, IT technicians support
printers that print documents, receipts, photos, and even 3D objects. Many of these printers are multifunctional and
not only print but also scan and fax documents or photos.
On the output side of this process, the major categories of printer types include laser, inkjet (ink dispersion),
impact, thermal, and 3D printers. In the following sections, we look at the different types of printers for desktop
computing. Table 10-1 lists some popular printer manufacturers.

Scanners
As an output device, a printer converts digital data to hard copy on paper. Some printers are also multifunction
input devices that can work as a scanner to scan printed paper and print additional hard copies of that information
or create a digital file from it. The file can then be saved on a computer or sent out over a phone or network connection. A scanner can also be a dedicated device with no printing, copying, or faxing capability. Scanners, whether
dedicated devices or integrated in a printer, come in two primary types:
● Flatbed scanners must be fed one page at a time, with each page being lined up on a glass surface.
● ADF (automatic document feeder) scanners can automatically process a stack of papers, cards, or envelopes, pulling each page individually into a roller system for scanning and then spitting it out into a separate
tray.

For heavy business use, sometimes it’s best to purchase a dedicated machine for each purpose instead of bundling
many functions into a single machine. For example, if you need a scanner and a printer, purchase a good printer and a
good scanner rather than a combo machine. Routine maintenance and troubleshooting are easier and less expensive
on single-purpose machines, although the initial cost is higher. On the other hand, for home or small office use, a combo
device can save money and counter space.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to perform installation or maintenance steps on these
types of printers: laser, inkjet, impact, thermal, and 3D printers.
Laser Printers
Core 1 Objective 3.7
A laser printer is a type of electro-photographic printer that can range from a small personal desktop model to a
large network printer capable of handling and printing large volumes continuously. Figure 10-1 shows an example of
a typical laser printer for a small office.
Figure 10-1 A Samsung Xpress color multifunction
laser printer
Laser printers require the interaction of mechanical, electrical, and optical technologies. They work by placing
toner on an electrically charged rotating drum called the imaging drum, transferring the toner onto paper as the
paper moves through the system, and then fusing the toner to the paper. Figure 10-2 shows the seven steps of laser
printing.
Note that Figure 10-2 shows only a cross-section of the drum, mechanisms, and paper. Remember that the drum
is as wide as a sheet of paper. The mirror, blades, and rollers in the drawing are also as wide as paper. Also know
that toner responds to a charge and moves from one surface to another if the second surface has a more positive
charge than the first.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to solve a problem using your knowledge of the seven
steps of laser printing. Be sure you know the order of steps.
Laser Printing Steps
The seven steps of laser printing are described next:
1. Processing the image. A laser printer processes and prints an entire page at one time. The page data
comes to the printer encoded in a page description language (PDL), which describes the appearance of
the printed page that the printer understands. The firmware inside the printer processes the incoming
data to produce a bitmap (a bunch of bits in rows and columns) of the final page, which is stored in the
printer’s memory. One bitmap image is produced for monochrome images. For color images, one bitmap
is produced for each of four colors. (The colors are blue, red, yellow, and black—better known as cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black, and sometimes written as CMYK.)
2. Charging or conditioning. During charging, the drum is conditioned by a roller that places a high,
uniform electrical charge of –600 V to –1000 V on the surface of the drum. The roller is called the primary
charging roller or primary corona, and it is charged by a high-voltage power supply assembly. For some
printers, a corona wire is used instead of the charging roller to charge the drum.
3. Exposing or writing. A laser beam controlled by motors and a mirror scans across the drum until it
completes the correct number of passes. The laser beam is turned on and off continually as it makes a
single pass down the length of the drum, once for each raster line, so that dots are exposed only where
toner should go to print the image. A raster line, or scan line, is the horizontal line of dots across the
page or image. For example, for a 1200 dots-per-inch (dpi) printer, the beam makes 1200 passes for every
inch of the drum circumference. This means that 1200 dots are exposed or not exposed along the drum
for every inch of linear pass. The 1200 dots per inch down this single pass, combined with 1200 passes

per inch of drum circumference, accomplish the resolution of 1200 3 1200 dots per square inch of many
laser printers. For each exposed dot, the laser beam applies a charge of –100 V, which is significantly
more positive than for the unexposed dots on the drum. The charge on this image area will be used in
the developing stage to transmit toner to the drum surface.
4. Developing. The developing cylinder applies toner to the surface of the drum. The toner is charged
between –200 V and –500 V, and it sticks to the developing cylinder because of a magnet inside it.
A control blade prevents too much toner from sticking to the cylinder surface. As the cylinder
rotates very close to the drum, the toner is attracted to the parts of the drum surface that have a –100 V
charge, and it is repelled from the more negatively charged parts of the drum surface. The result is that
toner sticks to the drum where the laser beam has hit, and it is repelled from the areas where the laser
beam has not hit.
5. Transferring. During transfer, a strong electrical charge draws the toner off the drum onto the paper.
This is the first step that takes place outside the cartridge and the first step that involves the paper. The
soft, black transfer roller puts a positive charge on the paper to pull the toner from the drum onto the
paper. Then the static charge eliminator weakens the charges on both the paper and the drum, so the
paper does not stick to the drum. The stiffness of the paper and the small radius of the drum also help
the paper move away from the drum and toward the fusing assembly. Very thin paper can wrap around
the drum, which is why printer manuals usually instruct you to use only paper designated for laser
printers.
6. Fusing. The fuser assembly uses heat and pressure to fuse the toner to the paper. Up to this point, the
toner is merely sitting on the paper. The fusing rollers apply heat to the paper, which causes the toner
to melt, and the rollers apply pressure to bond the melted toner into the paper. The temperature of the
rollers is monitored by the printer. If the temperature exceeds an allowed maximum value (for example,
410°F), the printer shuts down.
7. Cleaning. A sweeping blade cleans the drum of any residual toner. The charge left on the drum is then
neutralized. Some printers use erase lamps in the top cover of the printer for this purpose. The lamps
use red light so they won’t damage the photosensitive drum.
For color laser printers, the writing process repeats four times, one for each toner color of cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black. Each color might require a separate image drum, although many color printers can use the same drum
for all four colors. Then the paper passes to the fusing stage, where the fuser bonds all toner to the paper and aids
in blending the four tones to form specific colors.
Cartridges and Other Replaceable Parts
The charging, exposing, developing, and cleaning steps use the printer components that undergo the most wear. To
make the printer last longer, some or all of these steps are done inside a removable cartridge that can be replaced
as a single unit. For older printers, all four steps are done inside one cartridge. For newer printers, the charging,
exposing, and cleaning steps are done inside the image drum cartridge. The developing cylinder is located inside
the toner cartridge. The transferring is done using a transfer belt that can be replaced on some printers, and the
fusing is done inside a fuser cartridge, which also might be replaceable.

The A1 Core 1 exam expects you to know these laser printer terms: imaging drum, fuser assembly, transfer belt, transfer roller, pickup roller, separate pads, and duplexing assembly.
Watching a video of the laser printing process can be helpful when trying to remember how it all works. A quick search
on YouTube returns several good videos about the laser printing process. Watching a short video is worth the time.

By using these multiple cartridges inside laser printers, the cost of maintaining a printer is reduced. You can
replace one cartridge without having to replace them all. The toner cartridge needs replacing the most often, followed by the image drum, the fuser cartridge, and the transfer assembly, in that order.
Other printer parts that might need replacing include the pickup roller, which pushes a sheet of paper forward
from the paper tray, and the separation pad (also called a separate pad), which keeps more than one sheet of paper
from moving forward. If the pickup roller is worn, paper may misfeed into the printer. If the separation pad is worn,
multiple sheets of paper may be drawn into the printer. Sometimes you can clean a pickup roller or separation pad
to prolong its life before it needs replacing.
Duplexing Assembly
A printer that is able to print on both sides of the paper is called a duplex printer or a double-sided printer. Many
laser printers and a few inkjet printers offer this feature. After the front of the paper is printed, a duplexing assembly,
which contains several rollers, turns the paper around and draws it back through the print process to print on the
back of the paper. Alternatively, some high-end printers have two print engines so both sides of the paper are printed
at the same time.
Inkjet Printers
Core 1 Objective 3.7
An inkjet printer (see Figure 10-3) uses a type of ink-dispersion printing and doesn’t normally provide the high-quality resolution of laser printers. Inkjet printers are popular because they are small and can print color inexpensively.
Most inkjet printers today can print high-quality photos, especially when used with photo-quality paper.
An inkjet printer uses a print head that moves
across the paper, creating one line of the image with
each pass. The printer puts ink on the paper using a
matrix of small dots. Different types of inkjet printers
form their droplets of ink in different ways. Printer manufacturers use several technologies, one of which is the
bubble-jet. Bubble-jet printers use tubes of ink that have
tiny resistors near the end of each tube. These resistors
heat up and cause the ink to boil. Then a tiny air bubble
of ionized ink (ink with an electrical charge) is ejected
onto the paper. A typical bubble-jet print head has 64 or
128 tiny nozzles, all of which can fire a droplet simultaneously. (High-end printers can have as many as 3000
nozzles.) Plates carrying a magnetic charge direct the
path of ink onto the paper to form shapes.
Inkjet printers include one or more ink cartridges
to hold the different colors of ink for the printer. Figure
10-4 shows four ink cartridges. A black cartridge is on
the left, and the three color cartridges are cyan, yellow,
and magenta. For this printer, a print head is built into
each ink cartridge.
Before replacing expensive parts in a printer, consider whether purchasing a new printer might be more cost-effective
than repairing the old one.

A stepper motor moves the print head and ink cartridges across the paper using a carriage and belt to move
the assembly and stabilizing bars to control the movement (see Figure 10-5). A paper tray can hold a stack of paper,
and a paper feeder on the back of the printer can hold a few sheets of paper. The sheets stand up in the feeder and
are dispensed one at a time. Rollers pull a single sheet into the printer from the paper tray or paper feeder. A motor
powers these rollers and times the sheet going through the printer in the increments needed to print the image. When
the printer is not in use, the assemblage sits in the far-right position, which is called the home position or parked
position. This position helps protect the ink in the cartridges from drying out. Figure 10-5 shows the assemblage
positioned so that the ink cartridges are accessible for replacement.

Some inkjet printers offer duplex printing. These printers are larger than normal inkjet printers because of the
added space required for the duplexing assembly. For duplex printing, be sure to use heavy paper (rated at 24-pound
paper or higher) so the ink doesn’t bleed through.
Even with single-sided printing, inkjet printers tend to smudge on inexpensive paper, and they are slower than
laser printers. If a printed page later becomes damp, the ink can run and get quite messy. The quality of the paper
used with inkjet printers significantly affects the quality of printed output. You should use only paper that is designed
for an inkjet printer, and you should use a high-grade paper to get the best results.
Weight and brightness are the two primary ways of measuring paper quality. The rated weight of paper (for example,
20–32 pounds) determines the thickness of the paper. Brightness is measured on a scale of 92 to 100.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
When purchasing an inkjet printer, look for the kind that uses two or four separate cartridges. One cartridge is
used for black ink. Three cartridges, one for each color, give better-quality color than one cartridge that holds all
three colors. Some low-end inkjet printers use a single three-color cartridge and don’t have a black ink cartridge.
These printers must combine all colors of ink to produce a dull black. Having a separate cartridge for black ink means
that it prints true black and, more important, does not use the more expensive colored ink for black print. To save
money, you should be able to replace an empty cartridge without having to replace all cartridges.
Photos printed on an inkjet printer tend to fade over time, more so than photos produced professionally. To make your
photos last longer, use high-quality photo paper (rated at high gloss or studio gloss) and use fade-resistant ink (such as
Vivera ink by HP). Then protect these photos from exposure to light, heat, humidity, and polluted air. To best protect
photos made by an inkjet printer, keep them in a photo album rather than displayed and exposed to light.
Note 5
It’s possible to refill an ink cartridge, and many companies will sell you the tools and ink you need as well as show you
how to do it. You can also purchase refilled cartridges at reduced prices. When you purchase ink cartridges, make sure
you know if they are new or refilled. Also, for best results, don’t refill a cartridge more than three times. Many manufacturers and retail shops will accept empty cartridges for recycling.
Note 6
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to install or maintain an impact printer’s print head,
ribbon, and tractor feed, or to work with the impact paper used in the printer.
Impact Printers
Core 1 Objective 3.7
An impact printer creates a printed page by using some mechanism that touches or hits the paper, similar to a
typewriter. The best-known impact printer is a dot matrix printer, which prints only text that it receives as raw data.
It has a print head that moves across the width of the paper, using pins to print a matrix of dots on the page. The
pins shoot against a cloth ribbon, which hits the paper, depositing the ink. The ribbon provides both the ink for
printing and the lubrication for the pinheads. The quality of the print on an impact printer is poor compared with
other printer types. However, you still see impact printers in use for three reasons:
● They use continuous tractor feeds and fanfold paper (also called computer paper) rather than individual
sheets of paper, making them useful for logging ongoing events or data.
● They can use carbon paper to print multiple copies at the same time.
● They are extremely durable, give little trouble, and seem to last forever.
Maintaining a dot matrix impact printer is easy. The impact paper used by these printers comes as a box of
fanfold paper or in rolls (used with receipt printers). When the paper is nearing the end of the stack or roll, a color
on the edge alerts you to replace the paper. Occasionally, you should replace the ribbon of a dot matrix printer. If
the print head fails, check on the cost of replacing the head versus the cost of buying a new printer. Sometimes,
the cost of the head is so high that it’s best to just buy a new printer. Overheating can damage a print head (see
Figure 10-6), so keep it as cool as possible to make it last longer. Keep the printer in a cool, well-ventilated area, and
don’t use it to print more than 50–75 pages without allowing the head to cool down.

Thermal Printers
Core 1 Objective 3.7
Thermal printers use heat to create an image. Two types of thermal printers are a direct thermal printer and a
thermal transfer printer. The older direct thermal printer burns dots onto specially coated paper called thermal
paper; this process was used by older fax machines. The process requires no ink and does not use a ribbon. Direct
thermal printers are often used as receipt printers that use rolls of thermal paper (see Figure 10-7). You know it’s
time to replace the paper roll on this type of thermal printer when it shows a color strip down one edge. The printed
image can fade over time or if it interacts with another heat source or ultraviolet light.

possible so it will last longer

A thermal transfer printer uses a ribbon that contains wax-based ink. The heating element melts the ribbon
(also called foil) onto special thermal paper so it stays glued to the paper as the feed assembly moves it through
the printer. Thermal transfer printers are used to print receipts, barcode labels, clothing labels, or container labels.
Figure 10-8 shows a thermal transfer printer used to make barcodes and other labels.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to install or maintain the feed assembly or heating
element used in thermal printers, or you might need to work with the special thermal paper used in the older direct
thermal printers.

transfer printer and a direct thermal printer

Thermal printers are reliable and easy to maintain. It’s important to regularly clean the print head on a thermal
printer because buildup can harden over time and permanently damage the head. Follow the printer manufacturer’s
directions to clean the print head. Some thermal printer ribbons have a print head cleaning stripe at the end, and it’s
a good idea to clean the head each time you replace the ribbon. Additionally, some manufacturers suggest cleaning
the head with isopropyl alcohol wipes.
When cleaning, remove any dust and debris that get down in the print head assembly. As you work, ground
yourself to protect the sensitive heating element against static electricity. Don’t touch the heating element with your
fingers. You might need to clean it with a lint-free cotton swab dabbed in isopropyl alcohol. Also, to prolong the life
of the print head, use the lowest heat setting for the heating element that still gives good printing results.
3D Printers
Core 1 Objective 3.7
While impact printers and thermal printers have been around for a very long time, a newer type of printer is the
3D printer. 3D printers use a plastic filament or a resin to build a 3D model of a digital image. In Figure 10-9, notice
the coil of filament, a thermoplastic strand, on the left that is fed into the 3D printer, which heats the plastic and
deposits thin layer upon layer onto the print bed to build a three-dimensional object. A print bed on a 3D printer

is where the filament is deposited to build the objects. Some print beds are fixed whereas others move, depending
on the technology used in the printer. Filament 3D printers are better able to create hollow objects, and filament is
less expensive than resin.
Figure 10-9 A 3D printer heats a plastic filament and layers
the plastic to build three-dimensional objects

A resin 3D printer uses resin, a liquid photopolymer, which is held in a resin tank with a transparent bottom.
A resin 3D printer projects UV light up through the bottom of the resin tank to cure layer under layer to build threedimensional objects. A 3D object printed using resin is printed upside down because it raises up out of the resin tank
layer by layer (see Figure 10-10). Resin 3D printers produce objects that are stronger and smoother than filament
3D printers, but resin is more expensive than filament. When using a resin printer, always be sure to wear gloves
because the resin is a toxin to your body. To fully harden an object printed using a resin 3D printer, you need a UV
light-curing station. Both the resin tank and the print bed are considered consumable parts of a 3D printer.

When setting up a 3D printer, make sure the printer is level. The most common file type for a 3D image file
is an STL file (.stl), which stands for stereolithography. You can buy premade images online from sites such
as thingiverse.com. If you want to design your own images, you’ll need a 3D modeling program. Some, such as
Sketchup (sketchup.com) and Tinkercad (tinkercad.com), are free and easy to learn. Others have a much steeper
learning curve and a higher price in exchange for more features. Any computer used for 3D imaging and design
will perform more quickly and gracefully with more RAM and CPU power. Before you start printing, do some
research online for tips on getting a cleaner finished product. YouTube has several informative videos by 3D
Printing Nerd (the3dprintingnerd.com), Matter Hackers (matterhackers.com), Thomas Sanladerer (toms3d.org),
and others.
Now let’s turn our attention to using Windows to install, share, and manage printers.
Using Windows to Install, Share, and Manage
Printers
Core 1 Objectives 3.6, 3.7
In this section of the module, you learn to install local and network printers, share an installed printer, secure a
shared printer, and remotely use a shared printer. You also learn about how to configure printer add-ons and features.
We begin with how to unbox a printer and then move on to installing local and network printers.
To properly unbox a printer, consider the following guidelines:
● Remove the printer from the box, keeping it upright, and remove protective packing foam pieces.
● Place the printer on a flat, hard surface near an outlet. The printer needs room for air movement
around it.
● Remove any protective tapes or film from the printer, including the control screen.
● Plug the power cord into the printer and the outlet.
● Press the power button on the printer, and allow it to turn on fully.
● Add paper to the paper tray. If needed, remove protective tape from ink cartridges.
● Configure settings for intended use.
Local or Network Printer
Core 1 Objectives 3.6, 3.7
A printer connects to a single computer or to the network:
● A local printer connects directly to a computer by way of a USB port or wireless connection (Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi). Most printers these days support more than one method.
● A network printer has an Ethernet port to connect directly to the network or uses Wi-Fi to connect to a
wireless access point.
Some printers have both an Ethernet port and a USB-B port (see Figure 10-11), as well as multiple wireless connection options. These printers can be installed as either a network printer (connecting directly to the network) or
a local printer (connecting directly to a computer).

Two ways to install a printer and make it available on a network are as follows:
● Shared local printer. Connect a local printer to a computer on the network, and then share the printer
through the computer’s network connection. See the local printer and computer A in Figure 10-12. Keep in
mind the following two requirements when sharing a local printer:
■ For a shared local printer to be available to other computers on the network, the host computer must
be turned on and not in sleep or standby mode.
■ For another computer on the network to use the shared printer, the appropriate printer drivers for the
computer’s OS must be installed on the remote computer.

● Network printer. A network printer can connect directly to a network with its own NIC (see the network
printer in Figure 10-12), and it is identified on the network by its IP address or host name. To use the printer,
any computer on the network can install this printer and print to it; this is called remote printing.
A computer can have several printers installed. Of these, Windows designates one printer to be the default printer,
which is the one Windows prints to unless another is selected.
Note 7
Wired or Wireless Printer Connections
Core 1 Objectives 3.6, 3.7
Connecting a wired printer (USB or Ethernet) is easy:
● USB. Plug the USB cable into the printer and computer, and Windows installs the printer automatically.
● Ethernet. Plug the Ethernet cable into the printer and network wall jack, switch, or router, and install the
printer as a network printer on any computer on the network.
Connecting a wireless printer is a little more complex:
● Bluetooth. For a Bluetooth printer installed as a local printer, turn on Bluetooth in Windows, move the
printer within range of the computer, and watch as the two Bluetooth devices pair up. While you might need
to navigate some of the Bluetooth settings on the printer’s display to enable pairing, the process works like
most other Bluetooth connections.
● Wi-Fi infrastructure mode. In infrastructure mode, Wi-Fi devices connect to a Wi-Fi access point, such
as a SOHO router. Put the Wi-Fi printer within range of the access point and use controls on the printer to
select the Wi-Fi network using the highest IEEE standard (802.11x) supported by both the access point and
the printer. Enter the security key to the network if one is required. All Wi-Fi printers support infrastructure
connections, and some Wi-Fi printers can handle ad hoc connections, which are discussed next.
● Wi-Fi ad hoc mode. Some Wi-Fi printers can connect directly to a nearby computer in a Wi-Fi ad hoc mode
network to be installed as a local printer. This is accomplished in different ways depending on the technology available in the printer and the computer:
■ Many modern Wi-Fi printers include the ability to host a Wi-Fi hotspot to which nearby computers can
connect. The main disadvantage here is that most computers can connect to only one Wi-Fi network
at a time, so if a computer is connected to the printer’s Wi-Fi network, it can’t communicate with the
Internet or other network resources.
■ The reverse arrangement might work better: Set up a mobile hotspot on the computer and connect the
printer to the computer’s hotspot. In Windows 10, click the computer’s notifications icon in the taskbar,
and click the Mobile hotspot tile to turn it on. Right-click the tile, and click Go to Settings, where
you’ll find the hotspot’s network name and network password. On the printer, use that information to
connect to the computer’s hotspot.
Installing a Local or Network Printer
Core 1 Objectives 3.6, 3.7
With some printers, you launch the installation program that came bundled on the setup CD or was downloaded
from the printer manufacturer’s website. With others, use the Windows Settings app or the Devices and Printers
window in Control Panel to install a printer. These windows are also used to manage and uninstall printers, as you’ll
see throughout the rest of this module.

Choosing a Driver
Core 1 Objective 3.6
When you install a printer, printer drivers are required that are compatible with the installed operating system.
Be sure to use 32-bit drivers for a 32-bit OS and 64-bit drivers for a 64-bit OS. Windows has many printer drivers
built in. The drivers might also come on a CD bundled with the printer or you can download them from the printer
manufacturer’s website. Using the drivers downloaded from the manufacturer’s website ensures you have the most
up-to-date version of the full drivers, with support for all of a printer’s features.
Some printer manufacturers give you a choice of drivers based on the PDL included. The most common PDLs
are PCL and Postscript. Hewlett-Packard developed Printer Control Language (PCL), which is used by many different printer manufacturers and supported by many different OSs, providing you the flexibility to work in different
environments. PCL depends on the drivers in the printer hardware for creating print data, which results in a higher
print-processing speed compared to Postscript (described next). Consistency in printer outputs can vary between
printers with PCL because hardware varies, which also means the final print quality depends on the quality of the
printer.
The alternative, Adobe’s Postscript (PS), is also used by many different printer manufacturers but supported by
fewer OSs compared to PCL because it is mostly focused for use with Macintosh devices. Postscript does not rely on
the printer to create the print data; this creates consistency in print quality between different Postscript printers.
In Postscript, graphics are more detailed and have larger file sizes. Postscript is favored by graphics-intense users,
especially those who need to produce high-volume output. A designer can test their design with a sample on their
printer and then outsource the volume print job to a print shop that uses Postscript to ensure consistent quality.
When a printer offers a choice of drivers between PCL or Postscript, choose PCL for general applications and speed,
and choose Postscript for graphic-intense applications printing.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you need to know which type of driver to choose—PCL
or Postscript.
Installing a Printer
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objectives: 3.6, 3.7
Installing a network printer is sometimes called mapping a printer. Windows has many preinstalled printer drivers
that make printer installation particularly easy and straightforward. However, some manufacturers recommend that
you install their drivers before connecting the printer to your computer or the network. This provides additional
printer configuration and management tools that are not included in the Windows drivers. Follow these steps to
install a wired or Wi-Fi network printer or Bluetooth printer using the Windows drivers, or follow more specific
instructions from the printer’s manufacturer:
1. Make sure the printer is connected to the network or the computer. In Windows, open the Settings app,
click Devices, and then click Printers & scanners. Click Add a printer or scanner. (For Windows 11, in
the Settings app, select Bluetooth & devices, Printers & scanners, and Add device.) Windows searches
for available printers and lists them (see Figure 10-13).

● My printer is a little older searches for older printer drivers.
● Select a shared printer by name allows you to enter a network location for the printer.
● Add a printer using a TCP/IP address or hostname allows you to address the printer by IP address or
host name.
● Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer searches again for printers connected
through Bluetooth or the network.
● Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings gives you the option to make more
granular changes to the printer’s installation, use a setup CD or downloaded drivers provided by the
manufacturer, or select an appropriate driver from a list of available Windows printer drivers. In the
next box, choose the port where the printer is connected, and click Next. Then you can select the
brand and printer model to use drivers provided by Windows (see the left side of Figure 10-14), or you
can use drivers stored on CD or previously downloaded from the web by clicking Have Disk. The Install
From Disk box appears (see the right side of Figure 10-14). Click Browse to locate the drivers; Windows
is looking for an .inf file. Be sure to select 32-bit or 64-bit drivers, depending on which type of OS you
are using; then click OK.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to install a local or network printer.
Sharing a Printer on a Network
Core 1 Objective 3.6
Recall from the module “Networking Fundamentals” that a print server manages network printers and makes them
available to computers and other devices on the network. Any time a computer sends a print job to a printer through
the network, whether that printer is a shared local printer or a network printer, print server functions play a role.
However, the device that provides the print server can vary depending on how the printer is set up. Let’s look at
the available options:
● Integrated print server. Most printers today include network capability—you can connect them directly
to a router or switch, and devices on the network can find and access the printer. In this case, the printer
is providing its own integrated print server embedded in the firmware on the printer’s hardware. Some
integrated printers allow you to manage print protocols, start or stop jobs in the print queue, reorder jobs

in the queue, cancel specific jobs coming from a particular computer on the network, monitor printer
maintenance tasks, and set up your email address so the printer alerts you by email when it has a problem.
● Computer as a print server. When a computer shares its local printer with other computers on the network,
the computer is considered to be a print server. If a network has several print servers, you might find it
convenient as an IT support technician to use the Print Management console on your workstation to manage
these print servers. Using Print Management, you can stop, start, and clear print jobs on any print server on
the network and troubleshoot other printer problems from your workstation. Print Management is available
under Windows 10 Administrative Tools or Windows 11 Windows Tools in the Control Panel.
● Other network hardware. Print server software might be embedded in other network devices, such as a
router or firewall. Connect the printer to the network device, and use its configuration interface to manage
the printer.
Configuring and Using a Shared Printer
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.6
To share an installed local or network printer with others on the network, follow these steps:
1. In the printer Properties dialog box, which you access through the Settings app or Control Panel, click the
Sharing tab. Check Share this printer (see the middle box in Figure 10-17).
Applying Concepts
Figure 10-17 Share the printer and decide how printer sharing is handled
2. You can then change the share name of the printer. Notice in Figure 10-17 the option to control where print
jobs are rendered. A print job can be prepared (rendered) on the remote computer (client computer) or this
computer (print server). Your choice depends on which computer you think can best handle the computing
burden. You can test several print jobs on remote computers with rendering at either location to see which
method best uses computing resources on the network.
3. If you want to make drivers for the printer available to remote users who are using an operating system
other than the OS on this computer, click Additional Drivers.

Secure a Shared Printer
Consider the following features, which can be used to ensure the security of your shared printer and the privacy of
data embedded in documents to be printed:
● User authentication. In the printer’s Properties dialog box (refer back to Figure 10-17), click the Security tab
to manage who has access to the printer and permissions allowed. Notice in Figure 10-18 that the Everyone
group can print, but it is not allowed to manage the printer or documents sent to it. Just as with shared
files and folders, you can share the printer with specific users and/or set up a customized user group that is
allowed to use a printer. In this way, user authentication is required before giving a user access to the printer.
4. The Additional Drivers box opens (see the right side of Figure 10-17). For 32-bit operating systems, select
x86. For 64-bit operating systems, select x64. Click OK to close the box. You might be asked for the
Windows setup DVD or other access to the installation files.
5. Click OK to close the Properties dialog box. A shared printer shows a two-friends icon under it or in the
status bar in the Devices and Printers window. The printer is listed in the Network group in File Explorer
on other network computers.
For the printer share to be successful, the following requirements must be met:
● The computer sharing the printer and the computer using the shared printer must both be connected to
the same network.
● The shared printer and the computer sharing it must be turned on.
● Both computers must allow file and printer sharing.

● Secured printing. Some larger network printers—such as those manufactured by Canon, Ricoh, and Xerox—
offer features to help secure print jobs. Secured printing is a security feature that allows documents to print
confidentially, only when the user knows the printing passcode and is ready at the printer to oversee the
document as it prints. When secure print is enabled, the user enters a passcode in the Printing Preferences
or the printer’s Properties dialog box before printing. The print job does not start until the user goes to
the printer and enters the passcode on the printer. The steps to enable secure printing vary based on the
manufacturer. Refer to the printer’s owner’s manual to find the steps needed to use secure print. To enable
secured printing, do the following:
■ On a Canon printer, change the profile to Secured Print.
■ On a Ricoh printer, change the output to Locked Print.
■ On a Xerox printer, change the job type to Secure Print.
● Audit logs. Windows is capable of maintaining a log of print jobs accessed in Event Viewer. These logs record
when, by whom, and the type of print job processed.
● Badging. Special printers, such as a 3D printer at a university or public library, sometimes need to have
restricted access. An organization can use badging to limit who is able to use the printer. Badging is a process of certifying users to use special printers. The badging process can include the following:
■ Attending an instructional class in person or online
■ Passing an assessment on content covered in the class
■ Signing an agreement about how the printer is to be used
■ Using a reservation system
■ Adding a badge to your credentials to access the equipment
Enable Printer Logging
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.6
To enable printer logging in Event Viewer, follow these steps:
1. Open Event Viewer. Navigate to Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows >
PrintService.
2. Right-click Operational in the left pane, and select Properties. The Log Properties – Operational dialog
box opens.
3. Check Enable logging, and click OK.
4. Print a test page or print to a PDF to create an event in the printer logs.
5. Click Action in the Event Viewer menu bar, and select Refresh.
6. Review the printer logs that were recorded, and explore what information you find in the logs you just
created.
Applying Concepts
Use a Shared Printer
To install a shared printer on a remote computer, you can (1) use the Settings app, (2) use the Devices and Printers
window, or (3) use File Explorer. Here are the general steps for all three methods:
● Settings app. On a Windows 10 remote computer, open the Printers & scanners window, and click Add a
printer or scanner. (For Windows 11, in the Settings app, open Bluetooth & devices, click Printers & scanners, and click Add device.) Click The printer that I want isn’t listed to tell the computer where to find
the printer. Choose Select a shared printer by name to locate the printer by name, such as \\MJWEST\
EPSON XP-330 Series (jillwest), or click Browse to find the printer on the network. You’ll need to enter sign-in

credentials for the computer sharing the printer. For the user name to work, the printer must be shared
with this specific user or user group, and the password must match the password of this user on the remote
computer. Then select the printer and click Select (see Figure 10-19). Click Next. Once the printer is selected,
Windows attempts to use printer drivers found on the host computer. If it doesn’t find the drivers, you will
be given the opportunity to provide them on CD or other media.
Figure 10-19 Locate a shared printer on the network
If you don’t see a shared printer in the list of printers to add, the user account might not be authorized to access
resources on the remote computer. In this situation, use the Explorer method discussed later in this list, which allows
the user to authenticate to the remote computer.
● Devices and Printers window. On a remote computer, open the Devices and Printers window, click Add
a printer, and follow the directions on-screen to add a network printer. Select the shared printer, which
shows the sharing computer’s host name and the printer name in the printer address column, or click The
printer I want isn’t listed and browse the network to find the printer. Windows attempts to use printer drivers found on the host computer. If it doesn’t find the drivers, you will be given the opportunity to provide
them on CD or other media.
● File Explorer. In the Explorer window, drill down into the computer that is sharing the printer. If required,
authenticate to the remote computer with a valid user account and password on the remote computer. For
the user name to work, the printer must be shared with this specific user or user group and the password
must match the password of this user on the remote computer. After authentication, you can see the shared
printer. Right-click the printer, and select Connect (see Figure 10-20). In the warning box that appears, click
Install driver, and follow the directions on-screen.

After the printer is installed, be sure to send a test page to the printer to verify that the installation is successful.
Network Scan Services
Core 1 Objective 3.6
Multifunction and scanner devices typically offer a few convenient features for sending a scanned file to your desired
location. The scanner might offer local destinations, such as printing a paper copy or sending a scan file to a USB
flash drive connected directly to the scanner, but the scanner might also offer a few other destinations. The following scan destinations are common options on network printers/scanners:
● Scan-to-email. An email destination is fairly straightforward in its setup, but it can vary slightly from device
to device. On the scanner, select email as the scan destination, and enter a valid email address. Some scanners will require an email verification before completing the email configuration. Usually this means the
scanner will send a confirmation email to the email address provided with a PIN or code to verify the email
address is valid. You can also choose to keep the address in a locally stored contact list for frequently used
emails.
● Scan-to-SMB. Scan-to-SMB is a convenient way to scan files to a file server. Recall from the module “Networking Fundamentals” that SMB is a protocol used by file servers on the network. To set up scan-to-SMB,
follow the specific steps from the printer’s user manual. Generally, this is the information you’ll need to set
up scan-to-SMB:
■ Host IP address
■ File path to the SMB server or shared folder
■ User name and password for the SMB server or shared folder (Create a unique user name and
password for the share folder ownership to limit access to another user’s credentials.)

● Scan-to-cloud. The cloud scan destination is convenient for making a scanned document available to
multiple devices on different networks. Scan-to-cloud can upload directly to cloud hosting services, such
as Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive. To set up a cloud scan destination, follow directions from the printer
user manual and the cloud service you choose as a destination for the scan. Generally, you’ll need the
user name and password for the cloud service, and you’ll need to choose a cloud service that is supported
by the printer.
Configuring Printer Features and Add-On Devices
Core 1 Objective 3.6
After the printer is installed, use the printer Properties dialog box to manage printer features and hardware
devices installed on the printer. To access settings for the EPSON printer shown in Figure 10-21, click the General
tab, and then click Preferences to open the Printing Preferences dialog box, which shows the available options
(see the right side of Figure 10-21). Other printers might show a Device Settings tab. The options depend on the
installed printer. As you can see in the figure, the Main tab lets you control the size of the paper, page orientation
(landscape or portrait), quality of printing (for example, draft, standard, or high quality), color options (color
or black/grayscale), one-sided or two-sided (called duplex printing), collated or uncollated, and various add-on
devices depending on the printer, such as a printer hard drive, stapler, or stacker unit. Figure 10-22 shows an HP
Printing Preferences dialog box where you can choose the paper source, which determines which paper tray is
used to print.

Printer Maintenance
Core 1 Objective 3.7
Printers generally last for years if they are properly used and maintained. To get the most out of a printer, it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s directions when using the device and to perform the necessary routine maintenance. For example, the life of a printer can be shortened if you allow the printer to overheat, don’t use approved
paper, or don’t perform maintenance when required.
Online Support for Printers
Core 1 Objective 3.7
The printer manufacturer’s website is an important resource when supporting printers. Often, you can find online
documentation, warranty information, a knowledge base of common problems and solutions, updated device drivers, replacement parts available for order, and printer maintenance kits.
When working on printers, always keep in mind the following hazards:
● Dangerous electricity. A printer might still keep power even when it is turned off. To ensure that the printer
has no power, unplug it. Even when a laser printer is unplugged, internal components might still hold a
dangerous electrical charge for some time.
● Hot to touch. Some laser printer parts can get hot enough to burn you while in operation. Before you work
inside a laser printer, turn it off, unplug it, and wait about 30 minutes for it to cool down.
● Laser beam. For your protection, the laser beam in a laser printer is always enclosed inside a protective
case. Therefore, when servicing a laser printer, you should never have to look at the laser beam, which can
damage your eyes.
● Static electricity. To protect sensitive memory modules and hard drives inside printers, be sure to use an
ESD strap when installing them. You don’t need to wear an ESD strap when exchanging consumables such
as toner cartridges, fuser assembles, or image drums.
● Working inside high-voltage equipment when no one is around. Here’s one more tip to stay safe, although
we don’t want it to frighten you: When you work inside high-voltage equipment such as a laser printer, don’t
do it when no one else is around. If you have an emergency, someone needs to be close by to help you.
If you’re working with laser printer toner cartridges and you get toner dust on your clothes or hands while exchanging
the cartridge, don’t use hot water to clean it up. Remember that heat sets the toner. Go outdoors, and use a can of
compressed air to blow off the toner. Then use cold water to clean your hands and clothes. It’s a good idea to wear a
smock or apron when working on printers.
Note 10
Figure 10-24 shows an ink cartridge being installed in an inkjet printer. To replace an inkjet cartridge, turn on
the printer and open the front cover. The printer releases the cartridges from their parked positions. You can then
open the latch on top of the cartridge and remove it. Install the new cartridge as shown in the figure.

Cleaning a Printer
Core 1 Objective 3.7
A printer gets dirty inside and outside as stray toner, ink, dust, and bits of paper accumulate. As part of routine
printer maintenance, you need to regularly clean the printer. How often depends on how much the printer is used
and the environment in which it is used. Some manufacturers suggest that a heavily used printer be cleaned weekly,
and others suggest you clean it whenever you exchange the toner, ink cartridges, or ribbon.
Clean the outside of the printer with a damp cloth. Don’t use ammonia-based cleaners. Clean the inside of the
printer with a dry cloth and remove dust, bits of paper, and stray toner. Picking up stray toner can be a problem.
Don’t try to blow it out with compressed air because you don’t want the toner in the air. Also, don’t use an antistatic vacuum cleaner. You can, however, use a specialized vacuum cleaner designed to pick up toner, called a toner
vacuum. This type of vacuum does not allow the toner that it picks up to touch any conductive surface.
Some printer manufacturers also suggest you use an extension magnet brush. The long-handled brush is made
of nylon fibers that are charged with static electricity and easily attract the toner like a magnet. For a laser printer,
wipe the rollers from side to side with a dry cloth to remove loose dirt and toner. Don’t touch the soft, black roller
(the transfer roller), or you might affect the print quality. You can find specific instructions for cleaning a printer on
the printer manufacturer’s website.
Calibrating a Printer
Core 1 Objective 3.7
An inkjet printer might require calibration to align and/or clean the inkjet nozzles, which can solve a problem when
colors appear streaked or out of alignment. To calibrate the printer, you might use the menu on the printer’s control panel or use software that came bundled with the printer. How to access these tools differs from one printer to
another. See the printer manual to learn how to perform the calibration. For some printers, a Services tab is added
to the printer Properties window. Other printer installations might put utility programs in the Start menu. The first
time you turn on a printer after installing ink cartridges, it’s a good idea to calibrate the printer.
If an inkjet printer still does not print after calibrating it, you can try to manually clean the cartridge nozzles.
Check the printer manufacturer’s website for directions. For most inkjet printers, you are directed to use clean,
distilled water and cotton swabs to clean the face of the ink cartridge, being careful not to touch the nozzle plate.

To prevent the inkjet nozzles from drying out, don’t leave the ink cartridges out of their cradle for longer than 30
minutes. Here are some general directions:
1. Following the manufacturer’s directions, remove the inkjet cartridges from the printer, and lay them on
their sides on a paper towel.
2. Dip a cotton swab in distilled water (not tap water), and squeeze out any excess water.
3. Hold an ink cartridge so that the nozzle plate faces up, and use the swab to clean the area around the
nozzle plate, as shown in Figure 10-25. Do not clean the plate itself.
Figure 10-25 Clean the area around the nozzle plate with a
damp cotton swab
Nozzle head
should not be
cleaned
4. Hold the cartridge up to the light and make sure that no dust, dirt, ink, or cotton fibers are left around
the face of the nozzle plate. Make sure the area is clean.
5. Clean all the ink cartridges the same way, and replace the cartridges in the printer.
6. Print a test page. If print quality is still poor, try calibrating the printer again.
7. If you still have problems, you need to replace the ink cartridges.
Laser printers automatically calibrate themselves periodically. You can instruct a laser printer to calibrate at
any time by using the controls on the front of the printer or the browser-based utility program that is included in
the firmware of a network printer. To access the utility, enter the IP address of the printer in the browser address
box, and sign in.
Printer Maintenance Kits
Core 1 Objective 3.7
Manufacturers of high-end printers provide printer maintenance kits, which include specific printer components,
step-by-step instructions for performing maintenance, tips for how often maintenance should be done, and information on any special tools or equipment you need to do maintenance. For example, the maintenance plan for the HP
Color LaserJet 4600 printer says to replace the transfer roller assembly after printing 120,000 pages and to replace
the fusing assembly after 150,000 pages. The plan also says the black ink cartridge should last for about 9000 pages
and the color ink cartridge should last about 8000 pages. HP sells the image transfer kit, the image fuser kit, and the
ink cartridges designed for this printer.

To find out how many pages a printer has printed to determine if you need to do the maintenance, have the
printer give you the page count since the last maintenance. You can tell the printer to display the information or print
a status report by using buttons on the front of the printer (see Figure 10-26), or you can use utility software using
a computer connected to the printer. See the printer documentation to know how to get this report. For network
printers that offer a browser-based utility, enter the IP address of the printer in your browser, and use the utility to
find the counters. (Figure 10-27 shows such a utility for an Oki Data network printer.)
Figure 10-26 Use buttons on the front of the printer to display
information, including the page count
Figure 10-27 Use the web-based printer utility to read the printer counters
After you have performed the maintenance, be sure to reset the page count so it will be accurate when you need
to do the next routine maintenance. Keep a written record of the maintenance and other service done.
As examples of replacing printer consumables, let’s look at how to replace a toner cartridge, image drum, and
fuser for an Oki Data color laser printer.

Troubleshooting Printers
Core 1 Objectives 3.7, 5.6
In this part of the module, you learn some general and specific printer troubleshooting tips. As with all computer
problems, begin troubleshooting by interviewing the user, finding out what works and doesn’t work, and making
an initial determination of the problem. When you think the problem is solved, ask the user to check things out to
make sure they are satisfied with your work. After the problem is solved, be sure to document the symptoms of the
problem and what you did to solve it.
Printer Does Not Print
Core 1 Objectives 3.7, 5.6
When a printer does not print, the problem can be caused by any number of things. As you can see in Figure 10-37,
the problem can be isolated to one of the following areas:
● The application attempting to use the printer
● Windows, Windows settings, or printer drivers
● The printer itself
● Connectivity between the computer and its local printer or a network printer
4. Unpack the new fuser, and place it in the printer. Push the two blue levers toward the back of the printer
to lock the fuser in place.
As a last step whenever you service the inside of this printer, always carefully clean the LED erase lamps on
the inside of the top cover (see Figure 10-36). The printer maintenance kits you’ve just learned to use all include a
wipe to clean these strips.

In addition, if this is the first time you have tried to use the printer after installing it, the printer drivers or the
printer installation might be the problem. The following sections address printer problems caused by all of these
categories, starting with the application trying to use the printer.
Problems Printing from Windows
On the client computer, try to print a Windows test page. If the Windows test page does not print, do the following:
1. Check to see if the print spool is stalled. Open the printer’s queue, and try deleting all print jobs in the
queue. To cancel one document, right-click it, and click Cancel in the shortcut menu (see Figure 10-38).
To cancel all documents, click Printer, and then click Cancel All Documents. Try printing a Windows
test page again.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to solve problems with the print queue.
2. If the Windows test page also stalls in the queue, go to the printer, and check the following at the printer:
a. Is the printer on? Is it getting power?
b. Is there paper in the printer?
c. Does the control panel on the printer show an error code?
d. Can you print a printer self-test page by using controls at the printer? For directions to print a
self-test page, see the printer’s user guide. For example, you might need to hold down a button or
combination of buttons on the printer’s front panel. If this test page prints correctly, then the printer
is working. If the test page does not print, solve the problem with the printer itself.
3. If the printer is working, do a quick check to be sure you have communication with the printer before
you continue troubleshooting. Do the following:
a. Try pinging the printer. Open a command prompt window, enter ping, and then enter the IP address
of your printer. In Figure 10-39, the address is 192.168.2.200. If the printer replies (see Figure 10-39),
the problem is not network connectivity.

b. If the ping does not work, move on to steps covered in the section, “Problems with Connectivity for a
Network Printer or Shared Printer.”
c. For a USB printer, check the cable connection between the computer and the local printer.
4. If you have concluded you have connectivity with the printer, stop and restart the Windows Print
Spooler service. Windows uses the Services console to stop, start, and manage background services
used by Windows and applications. Do the following:
a. Enter services.msc in the Windows Run box. In the Services console, select Print Spooler (see
Figure 10-40). Click Stop to stop the service.
Figure 10-39 Use the ping command to determine if you have network connectivity with
 the printer
Figure 10-40 Use the Services console to stop and start the print spooler
b. To delete any print jobs left in the queue, open Explorer, and delete all files in the
C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS folder.
c. Restart the print spooler. Return to the Services console, make sure Print Spooler is selected, and
click Start. Close the Services console window.
5. If you still cannot print, reboot the computer. Try deleting the printer and then reinstalling it.
6. Check the printer manufacturer’s website for an updated printer driver. Download and install the correct
driver.

Problems with the Printer Itself
To eliminate the printer as the problem, check these things:
1. Is the printer on? Is it getting power? If there’s no image on the printer’s control panel display, the
printer is not getting power or it is turned off.
2. Does the printer have paper?
3. Look for an error message or error code in the control panel on the front of the printer. If the control
panel reports “Ready” or “Online,” then you can assume a network printer is communicating with the
network.
If you see an error code you don’t understand, search the printer documentation or website to find out its meaning.
Follow the directions on the printer manufacturer’s website to address the error code.
Note 11
4. Can you print a printer self-test page, as described earlier? If this test page prints correctly, then the
printer is working.
A printer self-test page might tell you the printer resolution and how much memory is installed. If this information is
not correct, try upgrading firmware on the printer.
Note 12
5. Try resetting the printer. (For some printers, press the Reset button on the printer.) Try powering down
or unplugging the printer and starting it again. As it starts up, look for any new error messages that
appear.
6. Is there a grinding noise? Typically a grinding noise means there is a problem with a gear, so look for
damage done to moving parts of the printer. Next, try the following:
● The carriage holding the ink cartridges could be stalled. Try a simple reset.
● Look for a paper jam. (Clearing a paper jam is covered next.)
● Reseat and possibly replace toner cartridges.
● Reseat both the charge roller and the transfer roller.
● If none of these steps stop the grinding noise, then consult with the printer’s manufacturer for further
help.
7. Is the paper installed correctly? Are the printer cover and rear access doors properly closed and locked?
Is there a paper jam?
8. If paper is jammed inside the printer, follow the directions in the printer documentation to remove the
paper. Don’t jerk the paper from the printer mechanism, but pull evenly on the paper, with care. You
don’t want to leave pieces of paper behind. Check for jammed paper from both the input tray and the
output bin. Check both sides. Laser and inkjet printers likely have a door in the back that you can open
to gently clear the jammed paper, as shown in Figure 10-41.

Figure 10-41 Open the door on the back of an inkjet
printer to remove jammed paper
9. Is the paper not feeding? Remove the paper tray and check the metal plate at the bottom of the tray. Can
it move up and down freely? If not, replace the tray. When you insert the tray in the printer, does the
printer lift the plate as the tray is inserted? If not, the lift mechanism might need repair.
10. Damp paper can cause paper jams, creases, and wrinkles. Is the paper in the printer dry? Paper that is
too thin can also crease or wrinkle in the printer.
11. For an inkjet printer, check if nozzles are clogged. Sometimes, leaving the printer on for a while will heat
up the ink nozzles and unclog them.
12. If the print head of an impact printer moves back and forth but nothing prints, check the ribbon. Is it
installed correctly between the plate and print head? Is it jammed? If the ribbon is dried out, it needs to
be replaced.
13. Is there an error with the printer finisher? Some printers have a printer finisher, which staples or holepunches papers at the end of a print job. If the stapler is malfunctioning, try resetting the finisher by
power cycling the printer while the cable to the finisher is disconnected. Next, reseat or replace the
staple cartridge, and remove any jammed staples. If the hole puncher is malfunctioning, dispose of the
punch scraps, make sure all the paper sizes are the same for the hole-punch job, and make sure the
paper type is appropriate for hole punching. Finally, check to make sure an administrator hasn’t disabled
one or both of the finishing features.
14. Check the service documentation and printer page count to find out if routine maintenance is due or
if the printer has a history of similar problems. Check the user guide for the printer and the printer
manufacturer’s website for other troubleshooting suggestions.
If you still cannot get a printer to work, you might need to take the printer to a certified repair shop. Before you
do, though, try contacting the manufacturer. You might also be able to open a chat session on the printer manufacturer’s website.
Problems with Connectivity for a Network Printer or Shared Printer
If the printer’s self-test page prints correctly (the printer is working) but you cannot ping the printer from the computer where the print job was issued, the next step is to suspect no connectivity between the printer and computer.
We call this computer the client computer in the following steps for a network printer:

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
1. Consider that the entire network might be down or the client computer is offline. Can the client
computer communicate with other devices or computers on the network? Can another computer on the
network communicate with the printer?
2. Consider that the IP address of the printer might have changed, which can happen if the printer is
receiving a dynamic IP address. Using Windows, delete the printer, and then install the printer again. If
this solves the problem, assign a static IP address to the printer to keep the problem from reoccurring.
3. Can you print to another network printer? If so, there might be a problem with the first printer’s
configuration. Try uninstalling and installing the printer at the client computer.
4. Check the network port on the printer and the switch or router to which the printer connects. Do the
network status indicator lights indicate connectivity and network activity? If not, try replacing the
network cable to the printer.
5. Use the printer’s browser-based utility, and check for status reports and error messages. Run diagnostic
software that might be available on the utility menu. Try flashing the printer’s firmware if updates are
recommended by the manufacturer.
6. Is the printer installed directly on the client computer or on another host computer that is acting as a
print server?
Even though you are using a network printer, it might have been installed as a printer that is shared on the
network by the host computer. Let’s look at an example of this situation. Figure 10-42 shows a Devices and Printers
window with several installed printers. Notice the two installations of the EPSON XP-330 Series printer. The first
installation was done by using a printer that was shared by another computer on the network. The second installation was done by installing the Epson printer as a network printer addressed by its IP address. When you print using
the second installation of the Epson printer, you print directly over the network to the printer. When you print to
the first installation of the Epson printer, you print by way of the other computer on the network. If this computer
is offline, the print jobs back up in the print queue until the computer is available.

When a computer has shared a local or network printer with others on the network, follow these steps to solve
problems with the shared printer:
1. Is enough hard drive space available on the client or host computer?
2. Did you get an “Access denied” message when you tried to print from the client computer? If so, you
might not have access to the host computer. On the client computer, go to Explorer and attempt to drill
down into resources on the printer’s computer. Perhaps you have not entered a correct user account
and password to access this computer; if that is the case, you will not be able to use the computer’s
resources. Make sure you have a matching Windows user account and password on each computer.
3. On the host computer, open the printer’s Properties dialog box, and click the Security tab. Select
Everyone and make sure Permissions for Everyone includes permission to print (refer back to
Figure 10-18).
4. Using Windows on the client computer, delete the printer, and then install the printer again. For best
results, install the printer directly over the network and not through another computer. Watch for and
address any error messages that might appear.
Poor Print Quality
Core 1 Objectives 3.7, 5.6
Poor print quality can be caused by the printer drivers, the application, Windows, or the printer. Let’s start by looking at what can cause poor print quality with laser printers and then move on to other problems that affect printouts.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 1 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to resolve problems with faded prints, echoes, vertical
lines or garbled characters on a page, wrong paper size, print appearing sideways on a page, and wrong print colors.
All these problems are covered in this part of the module.
Poor Print Quality for Laser Printers
For laser printers, poor print quality can include printing blank pages or faded, smeared, wavy, speckled, or streaked
printouts with vertical lines down the page. These problems often indicate that the toner is low. All major mechanical printer components that normally create problems are conveniently contained within the replaceable toner
cartridge. In most cases, the solution to poor-quality printing is to replace this cartridge.
Follow these general guidelines to fix poor print quality with laser printers:
1. If you suspect the printer is overheated, unplug it and allow it to cool for 30 minutes.
2. The toner cartridge might be low on toner, or it might not be installed correctly. Remove the toner
cartridge, and gently rock it from side to side to redistribute the toner. Replace the cartridge. To avoid
flying toner, don’t shake the cartridge too hard.
3. If this doesn’t solve the problem, try replacing the toner cartridge immediately.
4. Econo Mode (a mode that uses less toner) might be on; turn it off.
5. The paper quality might not be good enough. Try a different brand of paper. Only use paper
recommended for a laser printer. Also, be aware that some types of paper can receive print only on one
side.
6. The printer might need cleaning. Clean the inside of the printer with a dry, lint-free cloth. Don’t touch
the transfer roller, which is the soft, spongy black roller.
7. If the transfer roller is dirty, the problem will probably correct itself after several sheets print. If not, take
the printer to an authorized service center.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
8. Does the printer require routine maintenance? Check the website of the printer’s manufacturer to see
how often to perform maintenance and to purchase the required printer maintenance kit.
Extreme humidity can cause the toner to clump in the cartridge and give a Toner Low message. If this is a consistent
problem in your location, you might want to invest in a dehumidifier for the room where your printer is located.
Note 13
If loose toner comes out with your printout, the fuser is not reaching the proper temperature, and toner is not being
fused to the paper. Professional service is required.
Note 14
9. Streaking is usually caused by a dirty developer unit or corona wire. The developer unit is contained in
the toner cartridge. Replace the cartridge or check the printer documentation for directions on how to
remove and clean the developer unit. Allow the corona wire to cool, and clean it with a lint-free swab.
10. Speckled printouts can be caused by the laser drum. If cleaning the printer and replacing the toner
cartridge don’t solve the problem, replace the laser drum.
11. Distorted images can be caused by foreign material inside the printer that might be interfering with the
mechanical components. Check for debris that might be interfering with the printer operation.
12. If the page has a gray background or gray print, the image drum is worn out and needs to be replaced.
13. If an echo or ghost image appears as a double a few inches below the actual darker image on the page,
the problem is usually with the image drum or toner cartridge. The drum is not fully cleaned in the
cleaning stage, and toner left on it causes the ghost image. If the printer utility installed with the printer
offers the option to clean the drum, try that first. The next solution is to replace the toner cartridge. If
the problem is still not solved, replace the image drum.
Poor Print Quality for Inkjet Printers
To troubleshoot blank pages or poor print quality for an inkjet printer, check the following:
1. Is the correct paper for inkjet printers being used? The quality of paper determines the final print
quality, especially with inkjet printers. In general, the better the quality of the paper you use with an
inkjet printer, the better the print quality. Don’t use less than 20-pound paper in any type of printer
unless the printer documentation specifically states that a lower weight is satisfactory.
2. Is the ink supply low, or is there a partially clogged nozzle?
3. Remove and reinstall the cartridge(s).
4. Follow the printer’s documentation to clean each nozzle. Is the print head too close to or too far from
the paper?
5. In some printers, there is a little sponge near the carriage rest that can become clogged with ink. It
should be removed and cleaned.
6. If you are printing transparencies, try changing the fill pattern in your application.
7. Missing lines or dots on the printed page can be caused by the ink nozzles drying out, especially when
the printer sits unused for a long time. Follow the directions given earlier in the module for cleaning
inkjet nozzles.
8. Streaks or lines down the page can be caused by dust or dirt in the print head assemblage. Follow the
manufacturer’s directions to clean the inkjet nozzles.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Garbled Characters on Paper
If scrambled or garbled characters print on all or part of a page, the problem may be caused by the document being
printed, the application, connectivity between the computer and the printer, or the printer. Follow these steps to
zero in on the problem:
1. First, cancel all print jobs in the print queue. Then try printing a different document from the same
application. If the second document prints correctly, the problem is with the original document.
2. Try printing using a different application. If the problem is resolved, try repairing or reinstalling the
application.
3. For a USB printer, the problem might be with a USB hub, port, or cable. Is the USB cable securely
connected at both ends? If you are using a USB hub, remove the hub, connecting the printer directly to
the computer. Try a different USB cable or USB port.
4. Recycle the printer by powering it down and back up or by pressing a Reset button.
5. Update the printer drivers. Go to the website of the printer manufacturer to find the latest drivers and
follow the directions to install them.
6. If the problem is still not solved, the printer might need servicing. Does the printer need maintenance?
Search the printer manufacturer’s website for other solutions.
Paper Size Mismatch Errors
A printer gives a paper size error or paper mismatch error when the size of the paper, envelope, or other media in
the paper tray or feeder doesn’t match the paper size chosen in the printer’s settings for the current print job. This
error message prevents wasting toner or ink. To resolve the paper size mismatch error, do the following:
1. Check the paper size setting in the printer Properties or Printing Preferences dialog box, as shown in
Figure 10-43. Make sure the size selected is the same size as the paper or envelope loaded in the tray or feeder.

2. Remove and reload the paper in the tray or feeder. When reseating the paper, adjust the paper width
guides to gently touch the sides of the paper. Confirm the tray setting indicates the correct tray.
3. Reset the printer to clear any errors. Unplug the printer, wait at least a minute, and then reconnect the
power cord. Turn on the printer and wait for it to fully power on.
Print Comes out Sideways
Some printers try to fill the page with the print by automatically rotating from portrait mode to landscape mode
or vice versa. If the print comes out rotated but doesn’t fill the page, then use the printer’s Property dialog box to
change the setting to the opposite orientation. Another problem could be that the margins are set too small for the
printer capabilities, causing it to automatically rotate to try fit the content on the page. Adjust the margins to what
the printer can handle or use a different printer.
Wrong Print Colors
For a printer that is printing the wrong colors, sometimes called the chroma display, do the following:
1. Check to see if the paper you are using is designed to print on only one side. You might need to flip the
paper in the printer.
2. Try adjusting the print quality. These adjustments vary by printer. For one color laser printer, open the
Printing Preferences dialog box, and click the Quality tab (see the left side of Figure 10-44). You can
try different selections on this tab. To manually adjust the color, check Manual Color Settings, and then
click Color Settings. The Color Settings dialog box appears, as shown on the right side of Figure 10-44.
Figure 10-44 Adjust printing quality and color
3. For an inkjet printer, try cleaning the ink cartridges and calibrating the printer. One step in this process
prints a self-test page. If the self-test page shows missing or wrong colors, the problem is with the ink
cartridges. Try cleaning the ink nozzles. If that doesn’t work, replace the ink cartridges.
4. For a laser printer, try calibrating the printer if that option is available.

Solving Problems with Printer Installations
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objectives: 3.7, 5.6
Here are some steps you can take if the printer installation fails or installs with errors:
1. If you have problems, consider that Windows might be using the wrong or corrupted printer drivers. Try
removing the printer and then installing it again. To remove a printer in the Windows 10 Settings app,
select a printer, and click Remove device. (In Windows 11, click Remove.) To use Control Panel, right-click
the printer in the Devices and Printers window, and click Remove device. Try to install the printer again.
2. If the problem is still not solved, completely remove the printer drivers by using the printui command. The
Printer User Interface command, printui, is used by administrators to manage printers and printer drivers
on remote computers. You can also use it to delete drivers on the local computer. Follow these steps:
a. If the printer is listed in the Settings app or the Devices and Printers window, remove it. (Sometimes
Windows automatically puts a printer there when it finds printer drivers are installed.)
b. Before you can delete printer drivers, you must stop the print spooler service. Open the Services
console, and use it to stop the Print Spooler (refer to Figure 10-45). To delete any print jobs left in the
queue, open Explorer and delete all files in the C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS folder.
Applying Concepts
Figure 10-45 Use the printui command to delete printer drivers and possibly delete the
driver package (driver store)
(continues)
c. You can now start the print spooler back up. Because the printer is no longer listed in the Settings
app or the Devices and Printers window, starting the spooler will not tie up these drivers.
d. Open an elevated command prompt window, which is a window used to enter commands that
have administrator privileges. To open this window, type cmd in the Windows 10/11 search box, and
then click Run as administrator. Respond to the UAC box.
e. At the command prompt (see the left side of Figure 10-45), enter the command printui /s /t2.
In the command line, the /s causes the Print Server Properties dialog box to open, and the /t2 causes
the Drivers tab to be the selected tab.

f. The Print Server Properties dialog box opens, as shown in the middle of Figure 10-45. Select the
printer and click Remove. In the Remove Driver And Package dialog box (see the right side of
Figure 10-45), select Remove driver only, and click OK. It is not necessary to remove the driver
package. (This driver package, also called the driver store, can be installed on this computer or a
remote computer; it holds a backup of the printer drivers.)
g. When a warning box appears, click Yes. Close all windows.
3. Try to install the printer again. Start the installation from the CD that came bundled with the printer or by
using the printer setup program downloaded from the printer manufacturer’s website.
Module Summary
Printer Types and Features
● The two most popular types of printers are laser and inkjet. Other types of printers are impact printers (dot
matrix), thermal printers, and 3D printers. Laser printers produce the highest quality, followed by inkjet
printers. Dot matrix printers have the advantage of being able to print multicopy documents. 3D printers
use a plastic filament or a resin to build a 3D model of a digital image.
● The seven steps that a laser printer performs to print are processing, charging, exposing, developing, transferring, fusing, and cleaning. The charging, exposing, developing, and cleaning steps take place inside removable cartridges, which makes the printer easier to maintain.
● Inkjet printers print by shooting ionized ink at a sheet of paper. The quality of the printout largely depends
on the quality of paper used with the printer.
● Dot matrix printers are a type of impact printer. They print by projecting pins from the print head against
an inked ribbon that deposits ink on the paper.
● Direct thermal printers use heat to burn dots into special paper, and thermal transfer printers melt the ribbon or foil during printing.
● If you want to design your own images for three-dimensional printing, you’ll need a 3D modeling program.
Using Windows to Install, Share, and Manage Printers
● A printer is installed as a local printer connected directly to a computer or as a network printer that works
as a device on the network. Local printers can connect to a computer via a USB, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi connection. Network printers can connect to the network via an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. USB printers are
installed automatically in Windows.
● When a printer offers a choice of drivers between PCL or Postscript, choose PCL for general applications
and speed, and choose Postscript for graphic-intense applications printing.
● Windows installs, manages, and removes a printer using the Printers & scanners window in the Settings app
or the Devices and Printers window in Control Panel. You can also install a printer using a setup program
provided by the printer manufacturer. Always print a test page after installing a printer.
● A print server can be a computer on the network, firmware embedded in a network printer, or other network
hardware such as a router or firewall.
● A printer can be shared in Windows so others on the network can use it. To use a shared printer, the printer
drivers must be installed on the remote computer.
● Network printers are identified on the network by their IP address.
● The Windows print queue is managed from the Printers & scanners window or from the Devices and Printers window.
● Secure a shared printer with user authentication, secured printing, audit logs, and badging.

● Printer features—such as duplexing, collating, and page orientation—are managed in a printer Properties
dialog box.
Printer Maintenance
● An inkjet or laser printer can be calibrated to align the color on the page. The nozzles of an inkjet printer
tend to clog or dry out, especially when the printer remains unused. The nozzles can be cleaned automatically by means of printer software or buttons on the front panel of the printer.
● Check the page count of the printer to know when service is due and you need to order a printer maintenance
kit. The page count can be reported on the printer panel or through a web-based utility in the printer firmware.
Troubleshooting Printers
● When troubleshooting printers, first isolate the problem. Narrow the source to the printer, connectivity
between the computer and its local printer, the network, Windows, printer drivers, the application using
the printer, or the printer installation. Test pages printed directly to the printer or within Windows can help
narrow the source of the problem.
● Poor print quality can be caused by the printer drivers, the application, Windows, or the printer. For a laser
printer, consider that low toner can be the problem. For an inkjet printer, consider that the ink cartridges
need cleaning or replacing. The quality of paper can also be a problem.

3D Printer Badging
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 1 Objective: 3.6
3D printer badging is an interesting process. If you’ve never had access to a 3D printer before, consider taking a
class to explore using a 3D printer. Completing such a class could be useful for you if you ever need to support a 3D
printer. Research class options at your local library or university, and find out if they have a 3D printer available for
community use. If you don’t have a class available locally, you can find an online class available for free, such as the
one offered by Pikes Peak Library District in Colorado. Go to their website (research.ppld.org/3dprinting/badging), and
complete steps 1 and 2, which are to watch the video and take the assessment quiz. What was your score on the quiz?

Practicing Troubleshooting Printers
Est. Time: 1 hour
Core 1 Objective: 3.7
To practice troubleshooting printers, gather in a group or work individually on a printer available to you. On small
pieces of paper, write down 10–15 printer problems that you have learned how to fix in this module. Fold up the
pieces of paper, and put them in a pile. Take turns drawing a paper with a printer problem. Write down the problem
you need to solve as well as possible causes. Then, on the printer, perform the steps you would take to resolve that
issue. If you don’t have a printer to practice with, then write down the steps you would take, and compare answers
with your classmates. Possible problems you could use include the following:
● Lines down the printed pages
● Garbled print on the page
● Toner not fusing to the paper
● Paper jams
● Faded print
● Incorrect paper size
● Multipage misfeed
● Multiple prints pending in the queue
● Speckling on printed pages

Introduction
This module is the first of 11 modules that cover the CompTIA A1 Certification Exam Core 2 objectives. In this
module, you first learn about interpersonal skills (people skills, sometimes called soft skills) needed by an IT support
technician. Next, you learn what your employer might expect of you when using a ticketing system and dealing with
issues of change management and standard operating procedures. Finally, you learn about several operating systems
you might be called on to support, including their purposes, overarching differences, and issues surrounding how
they talk with each other.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam covers workstation and laptop operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and Chrome
OS. It also covers cell phone and tablet OSs, including iPadOS, iOS, and Android.
People respond reciprocally to the position of your facial
muscles. Try smiling when you greet someone and see
what happens.
Note 1
What Customers Want:
Beyond Technical Know-How
Core 2 Objective 4.7
Probably the most significant indication that an IT technician is doing a good job is that customers are consistently
satisfied. In your career as an IT support technician, commit to providing excellent service and to treating customers as you would want to be treated in a similar situation. One of the most important ways to achieve customer
satisfaction is to do your best by being prepared, both technically and personally. Being prepared includes knowing
what customers want, what they don’t like, and what they expect from an IT technician.
Equally important to being prepared technically is knowing how to work effectively with people in a technical
world, which is one of the most sought-after skills in today’s service-oriented work environments. An employer once
told me, “It’s not hard to find technically proficient people these days. But it’s next to impossible to find people who
know how to get along with others and can be counted on when managers are not looking over their shoulders.” I
could sense his frustration, but I also felt encouraged
to know that good social skills and good work ethics
can take you far in today’s world. My advice to you is
to take this part of the module seriously. It’s important
to be technically proficient, but the skills learned in
this part of the module just might be the ones that
make you stand out above the crowd to land that new
job or promotion.
Become a Competent and Helpful Support Technician
Core 2 Objective 4.7
The following traits distinguish a competent and helpful technician from a technician who is incompetent or unhelpful in the eyes of the customer:
● Be dependable and reliable. Customers appreciate and respect those who keep their word. If you promise
to be back at 10:00 the next morning, be there on time. If you cannot keep your appointment, never ignore
your promise. Call, apologize, explain what happened, and reschedule your appointment. Also, do your best
to return phone calls the same day and return email within two days.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Keep a positive and helpful attitude. This helps establish good customer relationships. You communicate
your attitude in your tone of voice, the words you choose, how you use eye contact, your facial expressions, how you dress, and in many other subjective and subtle ways. Generally, your attitudes toward your
customers stem from how you see people, how you see yourself, and how you see your job. Your attitude
is a heart issue, not a head issue. To improve your attitude, you must do it from your heart. That’s pretty
subjective and cannot be defined with a set of rules, but it always begins with a decision to change. As you
work with customers or users, make it a habit not to patronize or talk down to them. Don’t make customers
or users feel inferior. People appreciate it when they feel your respect for them, even when they have made
a mistake or are not knowledgeable about the issue you are trying to resolve. If a problem is simple to solve,
don’t make other people feel they have wasted your time. Your customer or user should always be made to
feel that the problem is important to you.
Quote from R.C., an employer: “When I choose a person to work for me, in a lot of cases, I choose based on their past
dependability or attendance. I am less concerned about a person’s ability because I can train anyone to do a specific
job. I cannot, however, train anyone to do anything if they are not present for me to train. Being dependable and reliable has a profound impact on customer relationships as well.”

Customer Service
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 4.7
Josie walked into a computer parts store and wandered over to the cleaning supplies looking for Ace monitor wipes.
She saw another brand of wipes, but not the ones she wanted. Looking around for help, she noticed Mary stocking
software on the shelves in the next aisle. She walked over to Mary and asked for help finding Ace monitor wipes.
Mary put down her box, walked over to the cleaning supply aisle without speaking, picked up a can of wipes, and
handed them to Josie, still without speaking a word. Josie explained she was looking for Ace wipes. Mary yelled over
three aisles to a coworker in the back room, “Hey, Billy! This lady says she wants Ace monitor wipes. We got any?” Billy
came from the back room and said, “No, we only carry those,” pointing to the wipes in Mary’s hand, and returned to
the back room. Mary turned to Josie and said, “We only carry these,” and then put the wipes back on the shelf. She
turned to walk back to her aisle when Josie said to Mary, “Well, those Ace wipes are great wipes. You might want to
consider carrying them.” Mary said, “I’m only responsible for software.” Josie left the store.
Discuss this situation in a small group of students and answer the following questions:
1. If you were Josie, how would you feel about the service in this store?
2. What would you have expected to happen that did not happen?
3. If you were Mary, how could you have provided better service?
4. If you were Billy, is there anything more you could have done to help?
5. If you were the store manager, what principles of good customer service would you want Billy and Mary
to know that would have helped them in this situation?
Applying Concepts
● Listen without interrupting your customer. When you’re working with or talking to a customer, focus on
them. Don’t assume you know what your customer is about to say. Let them say it, listen carefully, and don’t
interrupt (see Figure 11-1). Make it your job to satisfy this person, not just your organization, your boss,
your bank account, or the customer’s boss.

uncertainty can easily get upset when the unexpected happens. For these people, you need to make special
efforts to communicate early and often when things are not going as expected.
● Express patience and honor to those with physical disabilities. For the physically disabled, especially the
hearing- or sight-impaired, communication can be more difficult. It’s your responsibility in these situations
to do whatever is necessary to find a way to communicate. It’s especially important to have an attitude that
expresses honor and patience, which you will unconsciously express in your tone of voice, your choice of
words, and your actions.
Employers look for technicians with good social skills and work ethics because they realize that technicians with these
skills are good for business.

● Take ownership of the problem. Taking ownership of the customer’s problem means accepting the problem
as your own. Doing that builds trust and loyalty because the customer knows you can be counted on. Taking
ownership of a problem also increases your value in the eyes of your coworkers and manager. People who
don’t take ownership of the problem at hand are likely to be viewed as lazy, uncommitted, and uncaring.
One way to take ownership of a problem is not to engage your manager in unproductive discussions about
a situation they expect you to handle on your own.
● Portray credibility. Convey confidence to your customers. Don’t allow yourself to appear confused, afraid,
or befuddled. Troubleshoot the problem in a systematic way that portrays confidence and credibility. Get
the job done, and do it with excellence. Credible technicians also know when the job is beyond their
expertise and when to ask for help.
● Work with integrity and honesty. Don’t try to hide your mistakes from your customer or your manager.
Everyone makes mistakes, but don’t compound them by a lack of integrity. Accept responsibility and do
what you can to correct the error.
● Know the law with respect to your work. For instance, observe the laws concerning the use of software.
Don’t use or install pirated software.
● Behave professionally. A professional at work knows not to allow his emotions to interfere with business
relationships. If a customer is angry, allow the customer to vent, keeping your own professional distance.
(You do, however, have the right to expect a customer not to talk to you in an abusive way.)
● Use proper and polite language. Speak
politely and use language that won’t confuse
your customer. Avoid using slang or jargon,
which is technical language that only technical people understand. Avoid acronyms
(initial letters that stand for words). For
example, don’t say to a nontechnical customer, “I need to ditch your PCIe 16 card,”
when you could explain yourself better by
saying, “I need to replace the circuit board
inside your computer that controls video.”
● Show sensitivity to cultural differences.
Cultural differences between people from
different countries and communities can
result in different sets of expectations
when it comes to customer service. For
example, culture can affect our degree of
tolerance for uncertainty. Some cultures are
willing to embrace uncertainty, and others
strive to avoid it. Those who tend to avoid

● Dress professionally. Dress appropriately for the environment. Take a shower each day, and brush
your teeth after each meal. Use mouthwash. Iron your shirt. If you’re not in good health, try as best you
can to take care of the problem. Your appearance matters. Match your attire to the requirements of your
environment:
■ Business casual. For men, business casual is neutral-colored dress slacks, khakis, polo shirt, tailored
shirt, sweater, dark socks, dress shoes, and/or optional sports coat and tie. For women, business
casual is a blouse, tasteful sweater, simple dress or skirt, slacks, closed-toe shoe, and tasteful jewelry.
For both men and women, T-shirts, jeans, and shorts are usually not included. In a typical IT workplace,
assume business casual until your boss says otherwise.
■ Business formal. To shine at a job interview, always dress business formal. Business formal might
also be appropriate at work when you attend an upper-level management meeting or event. For men,
business formal includes matching jacket and slacks, shirt, and tie with dark socks and dress shoes.
For women, business formal is a dress pant or skirt with matching jacket. Skirt lengths should be at or
just above the knee. Make sure your blouse is not so short it shows your stomach and not so long it
covers the hem of your skirt. Wear closed-toe shoes and tasteful jewelry.

Core 2 Objective: 4.7
Jack had a bad day on the phones at the networking help desk in Atlanta. An electrical outage coupled with a generator failure had caused servers in San Francisco to be down most of the day. The entire help desk team had been
fielding calls all day explaining to customers why they did not have service and giving expected recovery times. The
servers were finally online, but it was taking hours to get everything reset and functioning. No one had taken a break
all afternoon, but the call queue was still running about 20 minutes behind. JinHee, the help desk manager, had
asked the team to work late until the queue was empty. It was Jack’s son’s birthday, and Jack’s family was expecting
him home on time. Jack moaned as he realized he might be late for Tyler’s party. Everyone pushed hard to empty
the queue. As Jack watched the last call leave the queue, he logged off, stood up, and reached for his coat.
And then another call comes in. Jack is tempted to ignore it, but decides he needs to answer it. It’s Lacy, the
executive assistant to the CEO (the chief executive officer over the entire company). When Lacy calls, all other priorities yield to her, and Lacy knows it. The CEO is having problems printing to the laser printer in his office. Would Jack
please walk down to his office and fix the problem? Jack asks Lacy to check the simple things: “Is the printer turned
on? Is it plugged in?” Lacy gets huffy and says, “Of course, I’ve checked that. Now come right now. I need to go.” Jack
walks down to the CEO’s office, takes one look at the printer, and turns it on.
He turns to Lacy and says, “I suppose the on/off button was just too technical for you.” Lacy glares at him in
disbelief. Jack says, “I’ll be leaving now.” As he walks out, he begins to form a plan as to how he’ll defend himself to
his manager in the morning, knowing the inevitable call to JinHee’s office will come.
In a group of two or four students, one student should play the role of Jack and another the role of JinHee.
Discuss these questions:
1. JinHee is informed the next morning of Jack’s behavior, and calls Jack into her office. She likes Jack and
wants him to be successful in the company. Jack is resistant and feels justified in what he did. As JinHee,
what do you think is important that Jack understand? How can you explain this to Jack so he can accept it?
What would you advise Jack to do?
2. Switch roles or switch team members and replay the roles.
3. What are three principles of relating to people that would be helpful for Jack to keep in mind?

● Control your words. Don’t gossip. Coworkers
might listen attentively to your negative gossip
about others, but they will now probably suspect
that you’ll gossip about them when their backs
are turned. Your credibility and trustworthiness
suffer when you gossip. And finally, don’t use
rough language; it is never appropriate.
Your customers might never remember what you said
or did, but they will always remember how you made
them feel.
Note 4
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know that when serving a customer, you should be on time, dress appropriately,
avoid distractions, set and meet expectations and timelines, communicate the status of the solution with the customer,
and deal appropriately with customers’ confidential materials.

Your customers can be internal, meaning you work for the same company and might consider the customers colleagues, or they can be external (they come to you or your company for service). Customers can be highly technical or technically naive, represent a large company or simply own a home computer, be prompt or slow at paying
their bills, want only the best (and be willing to pay for it) or be searching for bargain service, be friendly and easy
to work with or demanding and condescending. In each situation, the keys to success are always the same: Don’t
allow circumstances or personalities to affect your commitment to excellence, and treat the customer as you would
want to be treated.
First impressions are often lasting, so let’s start there.
Initial Contact With a Customer
Your initial contact with a customer might be when the customer comes to you (such as in a retail setting), when
you go to the customer’s site, when the customer calls you on the phone, when the customer reaches you by chat or
email, or when you are assigned a ticket (sometimes called an incident) already created when another person made
initial contact and entered the request in a tracking system of customer calls. In each situation, always follow the
specific guidelines of your employer. Let’s look at some general guidelines for handling first contact with customers.
When you answer the phone, identify yourself and your organization. (Follow your employer’s guidelines on
what to say.) Follow company policies to obtain specific information when answering an initial call, such as name
(get the right spelling), phone number, and business name. For example, your company might require that you
obtain a licensing or warranty number to determine whether the customer is entitled to receive your support. After
you have obtained the information you need and confirmed you are authorized to help the customer, open up the
conversation for the caller to describe the problem.
Prepare for on-site visits by reviewing information given to you by the person who took the call. Know the
problem you are going to address, the urgency of the situation, and what computer, software, and hardware need
servicing. Arrive with a complete set of equipment appropriate to the visit. That might include a toolkit, flashlight,
multimeter, ESD strap and mat, and bootable media.
When you arrive at the customer’s site, greet the customer in a friendly manner, and shake hands (see Figure 11-2).
Use terms such as Mr. or Ms. and Sir or Ma’am when addressing the customer unless you are certain the customer
expects you to use their first name. If the site is a residence, you should not remain there when only a minor is present. If a minor child answers the door, ask to speak with an adult, and don’t allow the adult to leave the house with
only you and the child present.

Figure 11-2 If a customer permits it, begin each new relationship
with a handshake

After initial greetings, the first thing you should do is listen and ask questions. As you listen, it’s fine to take
notes, but don’t start the visit by filling out your paperwork. Save the paperwork for later, or have the essentials
already filled out before you reach the site.
Interview the Customer
Troubleshooting begins by interviewing the user. Take notes as you ask the user questions, and keep asking questions
until you thoroughly understand the problem. Have the customer reproduce the problem, and carefully note each
step taken and its results. This process gives you clues about the problem and the customer’s technical proficiency,
which helps you know how to communicate with the customer.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to be able to clarify customer statements by asking open-ended questions to narrow
the scope of the problem and by restating the issue or question.
Use diplomacy and good manners when you work with a user to solve a problem. For example, if you suspect
that the user dropped the computer, don’t ask, “Did you drop the laptop?” Put the question in a less accusatory
manner: “Could the laptop have been dropped?”
Set and Meet Customer Expectations
Professional technicians know that it is their responsibility to set and meet expectations with a customer. It’s
important to create an expectation of certainty with customers so they are not left hanging without knowing what
will happen next.
Part of setting expectations is to establish a timeline with your customer for the completion of a project. If you
cannot solve the problem immediately, explain to the customer what needs to happen, and outline the likely timeline for a solution. Then keep the customer informed about the progress of the solution. For example, you can say
to a customer, “I need to return to the office and research the cost of parts that need replacing. I’ll call you tomorrow before 10 a.m. with an estimate.” If you later find out you need more time, call the customer before 10 a.m.,
explain your problem, and give him a new time to expect your call. This kind of service is very much appreciated
by customers, and if you are consistent, you will quickly gain their confidence.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Another way to set expectations is to give customers an
opportunity to make decisions about repairs to their equipment.
When explaining to the customer what needs to be done to fix a
problem, offer repair or replacement options if they apply (see
Figure 11-3). Don’t make decisions for your customer. Explain the
problem and what you must do to fix it, giving as many details as
the customer wants. When a customer must make a choice, state
the options in a way that does not unfairly favor the most lucrative solution for you as the technician or for your company. For
example, if you must replace a motherboard (a costly repair in
parts and labor), explain the total cost of repairs, and then help
the customer decide if it’s better to purchase a new system or
repair the existing one.
Work With a Customer on Site
As you work with a customer on site, avoid distractions. Don’t
accept personal calls or texts on your cell phone, and definitely
don’t check social media sites when you’re on the job. Most organizations require that you answer calls from work while on site,
but keep them to a minimum. Be aware that the customer might
be listening, so be careful not to discuss problems with coworkers, your manager, or other situations that might put the company,
its employees, or products in a bad light with the customer. If you
absolutely must excuse yourself from the on-site visit for personal
reasons, explain the situation to the customer, and return as soon
as possible.
When working at a user’s desk, follow these general guidelines:
1. As you work, be as unobtrusive as possible. Consider yourself a guest in the customer’s office or
residence. Don’t make a big mess. Keep your tools and papers out of the customer’s way. Don’t pile your
belongings and tools on top of the user’s papers, books, and so forth.
2. Protect the customer’s confidential and private materials. For example, if you are working on the printer
and discover a budget report in the out tray, quickly turn it over so you can’t read it, and hand it to the
customer. If you notice a financial spreadsheet is displayed on the customer’s computer screen, step
away and ask the user if they want to first close the spreadsheet before you work with the computer. If
sensitive documents are on the customer’s desk, you might let them know and ask if they would like to
put them out of your view or in a safe place.
3. Don’t take over the mouse or keyboard from the user without permission.
4. Ask permission again before you use the printer or other equipment.
5. Don’t use the phone without permission.
6. Accept personal inconvenience to accommodate the user’s urgent business needs. For example, if the
user gets an important call while you are working, don’t allow your work to interfere. You might need to
stop work and perhaps leave the room.
7. Also, if the user is present, ask permission before you make a software or hardware change, even if the
user has just given you permission to interact with the computer.
8. Don’t disclose information about a customer on social media sites, and don’t use those public outlets to
complain about difficulties with a customer.
In some IT support situations, it is appropriate to consider yourself a support to the user as well as to the
computer. Your goals can include educating the user as well as repairing the computer. If you want users to learn
something from a problem they caused, explain how to fix the problem, and walk them through the process if
necessary. Don’t fix the problem yourself unless they ask you to do so. It takes a little longer to train a user, but it

is more productive in the end because the user learns more and is less
likely to repeat the mistake (see Figure 11-4).
Work With a Customer on the Phone
Phone support requires more interaction with customers than any
other type of IT support. To understand customers’ problems and give
clear instructions, you must be able to visualize what customers see at
their computer. Patience is required if the customer must be told each
key to press or command button to click.
Help desk support requires excellent communication skills, good
phone manners, and lots of patience (see Figure 11-5). As your help desk
skills improve, you will learn to think through the process as though you
were sitting in front of the computer yourself. Drawing diagrams and
taking notes as you talk can be very helpful. In some cases, help desk
support personnel might use software, such as Freshdesk by Freshworks (freshdesk.com), that enables the remote control of customers’
computers. Always communicate clearly with customers when using
this type of software so they understand what type of access they are
allowing you to have on their computers.
If your call is accidentally disconnected, call back immediately.
Don’t eat or drink while on the phone. If you must put callers on hold,
tell them how long it will be before you get back to them. Speak clearly
and don’t talk too fast. Don’t complain about
your job, your boss, coworkers, your company,
or other companies or products to your customers. A little small talk is okay and is sometimes
beneficial in easing a tense situation, but keep it
upbeat and positive.
Deal With Difficult Customers
Most customers are polite and appreciate your
help. If you make it a habit to treat others as you
want to be treated, you’ll find that most of your
customers will tend to treat you well, too. However, you occasionally will have to deal with a
difficult customer. In this section of the module,
you learn how to work with customers who are
not knowledgeable, who are overly confident,
and who complain.
When the Customer Is Not Knowledgeable When on site, you can put a computer in good repair without depending on a customer to help you. But when you are trying to solve a problem over the phone, with a customer as your only
eyes, ears, and hands, a computer-illiterate user can present a challenge. Here are some tips for handling this situation:
● Be specific with your instructions. For example, instead of saying, “Open Explorer,” say, “Using your mouse,
right-click the Start button, and click File Explorer from the menu.”
● Don’t ask the customer to do something that might destroy settings or files without first having the customer
back them up carefully. If you think the customer can’t handle your request, ask for some on-site help.
● Frequently ask the customer what is displayed on the screen to help you track the keystrokes and action.
● Follow along at your own computer. It’s easier to direct the customer keystroke by keystroke if you are
doing the same things.
● Give the customer plenty of opportunity to ask questions.

When solving computer problems in an organization other than your own, check with technical support within that
organization instead of working only with the user. User might not be aware of policies that have been set on their
computers to prevent changes to the OS, hardware, or applications.
Note 5
● Genuinely compliment the customer whenever you can to help the customer gain confidence.
● If you determine that the customer cannot help you solve the problem without a lot of coaching, you might
need to tactfully request that the caller have someone with more experience call you. The customer will
most likely breathe a sigh of relief and have someone take over the problem.
When the Customer Is Overly Confident Sometimes customers might want to give advice, take charge of a
call, withhold information they think you don’t need to know, or execute commands at the computer without letting
you know so that you don’t have enough information to follow along. A situation like this must be handled with tact
and respect for the customer. Here are a few tips:
● When you can, compliment the customer’s knowledge, experience, or insight.
● Slow the conversation down. You can say, “Please slow down. You’re moving too fast for me to follow. Help
me catch up.”
● Don’t back off from using problem-solving skills. You must still have the customer check the simple things,
but direct the conversation with tact. For example, you can say, “I know you’ve probably gone over these
simple things already, but could we just do them again together?”
● Be careful not to accuse the customer of making a mistake.
● Even though the customer might be using technical jargon, keep to your policy of not using jargon back to
the customer unless you’re convinced they truly understand you.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know that it is important not to minimize a customer’s problem and not to be
judgmental toward a customer.
When the Customer Complains When you are on site or on the phone, a customer might complain to you
about your organization, products, or service or the product and service of another company. Consider the complaint to be helpful feedback that can lead to a better product or service and better customer relationships. Here
are a few suggestions that can help you handle complaints and defuse customer anger:
● Be an active listener, and let customers know they are not being ignored. Look for the underlying problem.
Don’t take complaints or anger personally.
● Give the customer a little time to vent, and apologize when you can. Then start the conversation by asking
questions, taking notes, and solving problems. Unless you must have the information for problem-solving,
don’t spend a lot of time finding out exactly who the customer dealt with and what happened to upset the
customer.
● Don’t be defensive. It’s better to leave the customer with the impression that you and your company are
listening and willing to admit mistakes. No matter how much anger is expressed, resist the temptation to
argue or become defensive.
● Know how your employer wants you to handle a situation where you are verbally abused. For example, you
might say something like this in a calm voice: “I’m sorry, but my employer does not require me to accept
this kind of talk.”

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● If the customer is complaining about a product or
service that is not from your company, don’t start
by saying, “That’s not our problem.” Instead, listen
to the customer complain. Don’t appear as though
you don’t care.
● If the complaint is against you or your product,
identify the underlying problem if you can. Ask
questions and take notes. Then pass these notes on
to people in your organization who need to know.
● Sometimes simply making progress or reducing the
problem to a manageable state reduces the customer’s anxiety. As you are talking to a customer, summarize what you have both agreed on or observed
so far in the conversation (see Figure 11-6).
● Point out ways that you think communication
could be improved. For example, you might say,
“I’m sorry, but I’m having trouble understanding
what you want. Could you please slow down, and
let’s take this one step at a time?”

Gawin is one of the most intelligent and knowledgeable support technicians in his group at CloudPool, Inc. He is
about to be promoted to software engineer, and today is his last day on the help desk. Simone, a potential customer with little computer experience, calls asking for help in accessing the company website. Gawin says, “The
URL is www dot cloud pool dot com.” Simone responds, “What’s a URL?” Gawin’s patience grows thin. He’s thinking
to himself, “Oh, help! Just two more hours and I’m off these phones for good.” In a tone of voice that makes it clear
Gawin thinks she’s an idiot, he says to Simone, “You know, lady! That address box at the top of your browser. Now
enter www dot cloud pool dot com!” Simone gets flustered and intimidated and doesn’t know what to say next. She
really wants to know what a browser is, but instead she says, “Wait. I’ll just ask someone in the office to help me,”
and hangs up the phone.
Discuss the situation with others in a small group and answer these questions:
1. If you were Gawin’s manager and overheard this call, how would you handle the situation?
2. What principles of working with customers does Gawin need to keep in mind?
Two students sit back to back, one playing the role of Gawin and the other playing the role of Simone. Play out
the entire conversation. Others in the group can offer suggestions and constructive criticism.
Applying Concepts
The Customer Decides When the Work Is Done
When you think you’ve solved the problem, allow the customer to decide if the service is finished to their satisfaction. For remote support, the customer generally ends the call or chat session, not the technician. If you end the
call too soon and the problem is not completely resolved, the customer can be frustrated, especially if it is difficult
to contact you again.

a place of agreement

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know to follow up with
the customer at a later date to verify their satisfaction.
For on-site work, after you have solved the problem, complete these tasks before you close the call:
1. If you changed anything on the computer after you booted it, reboot one more time to make sure you
have not caused a problem with the boot.
2. Allow the customer enough time to be fully satisfied that all is working. Does the printer work? Print a test
page. Does the network connection work? Can the customer sign in to the network and access data on it?
3. If you backed up data before working on the problem and then restored the data from backups, ask the
user to verify that the data is fully restored.
4. Review the service call with the customer. Summarize the instructions and explanations you have given
during the call. This is an appropriate time to fill out your paperwork and explain to the customer what
you have written. Then ask if they have any questions.
5. Explain preventive maintenance to the customer, such as deleting temporary files from the hard drive or
cleaning the mouse. Most customers don’t have preventive maintenance contracts for their computers
and appreciate the time you take to show them how to take better care of their equipment. One technician
keeps a pack of monitor wipes in his toolkit and ends each call by cleaning the customer’s monitor screen.
To demonstrate a sincere concern for your customer’s business and that you have owned the problem, it’s extremely important to follow up later with
the customer. Ask if they are still satisfied with your
work, and ask if they have any more questions. For
example, you can say to the customer, “I’ll call you on Monday to make sure everything is working and you’re still
satisfied with the work.” On Monday, make that call. As you do, you’re building customer loyalty.
Sometimes You Must Escalate a Problem
You are not going to solve every computer problem you encounter. Knowing how to escalate a problem properly
so it is assigned to people higher in the support chain is one of the first things you should learn on a new job. Know
your company’s policy for escalation. What documents or entries in the ticketing system software do you use? Who
do you contact? How do you pass the problem on—do you use email, a phone call, or an online entry in a database?
Do you remain the responsible “support” party, or does the person now addressing the problem become the new
contact? Are you expected to keep in touch with the customer and the problem, or are you totally out of the picture?
When you escalate, let the customer know. Tell the customer you are passing the problem on to someone who is
more experienced or has access to more extensive resources. If you check back with the customer only to find out
that the other support person has not called or followed through to the customer’s satisfaction, don’t lay blame or
point fingers. Just do whatever you can to help within your company guidelines. Your call to the customer will go a
long way toward helping the situation.
Working With Coworkers
Learn to be a professional when working with coworkers. A professional at work is someone who puts business
matters above personal matters (see Figure 11-7). In big bold letters, I can say the key to being professional is to
learn not to be personally offended when someone lets
you down or does not please you. Remember, most people
do the best they can considering the business and personal
constraints they are up against. Getting offended leads to
becoming bitter about others and about your job. Learn to
keep negative opinions to yourself, and to expect the best
of others. When a coworker starts to gossip, try to politely
change the subject.
Know your limitations, and be willing to admit when you
can’t do something. For example, Larry’s manager stops by
his desk and asks him to accept one more project. Larry
already is working many hours overtime just to keep up.
He needs to politely say to his boss, “I can accept this new
project only if you relieve me of some of these tasks.”

Active Learning
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 4.7
Ray was a new member of a corporate help desk team that supported hospitals across the nation. He had only had
a couple of weeks of training before he was turned loose on the phones. He was a little nervous the first day he
took calls without a mentor sitting beside him. His first call came from Fernanda, a radiology technician who was
trying to sign in to the network to start the day. When Fernanda entered her network ID and passcode, an error
message stated her user account was not valid. She told Ray she had tried signing in several times on two different
computers. Ray checked his database and found her account, which appeared to be in good order. He asked her to
try again. She did and got the same results. In his two weeks of training, this problem had never occurred. He told
her, “I’m sorry, I don’t know how to solve this problem.” She said, “Okay, well, thank you anyway,” and hung up. She
immediately called the help desk number back and the call was answered by Jackie, who sits across the room from
Ray. Fernanda said, “The other guy couldn’t fix my problem. Can you help me?”
“What other guy?” Jackie asked.
“I think his name was Ray.”
“Oh, him! He’s new and he doesn’t know much. Besides that, he should have asked for help. Tell me the problem.”
Jackie reset the account and the problem was solved.
In a group of three or more students, discuss and answer the following questions:
1. What mistake did Ray make? What should he have done or said?
2. What mistake did Jackie make? What should she have done or said?
3. What three principles of relating to customers and coworkers would be helpful for Ray and Jackie to keep
in mind?
Applying Concepts
Documentation and Support Systems
Core 2 Objectives 4.1, 4.2
Well-run IT departments rely on good documentation and support systems to keep up with all the information
surrounding IT operations in the entire organization. In this part of the module, you learn about the types of documentation and support systems you might encounter in your IT career and what is generally expected of you as an
IT technician to follow these best practices and policies.
Types of Documents and Support Systems
Core 2 Objective 4.1
Some examples of documents and systems an IT technician might encounter in an organization are:
● Knowledge base. A knowledge base is a collection of articles containing text, images, or video that give
information about a network, product, or service. Here are two examples of how a knowledge base might
be used:
■ Customer service. To better support customers, a company might publish a knowledge base about its
products or services on its website. Technical support specialists usually have access to a knowledge
base to aid in helping customers during support calls; the knowledge base might be integrated into a
ticketing system.

■ IT training and troubleshooting. As IT personnel install, configure,
and troubleshoot devices and software, the information they learn
can be documented in the IT department’s knowledge base so it’s
readily available for future troubleshooting and for training new IT
personnel.
● Asset management. Asset management tracks physical and digital
assets, including end-user devices, network devices, IP addresses, software licenses, and related licenses. These inventory lists are typically
maintained by software such as IT Asset Management by Alloy Software
(alloysoftware.com). The application might track equipment by using an
asset tag with an ID and a theft-prevention plate, such as the one shown
in Figure 11-8. These tags and plates contain barcodes that are easily
read by a laser scanner. Asset tracking software can scan the barcodes
to report on existing inventory, track equipment, report needed maintenance, and help with identifying and returning stolen property.
The software and hardware inventory lists might be maintained in a database system that includes
information used to manage the assets, such as the following:
■ The asset ID used to identify hardware equipment tracked in the system.
■ Procurement life cycle data needed to replace an aged asset. The procurement life cycle data might
include information on suppliers for the asset, contract terms for preferred suppliers, purchase orders,
invoices, payment processing, and delivery data.
■ Warranty and licensing information, such as terms of warranty for a hardware device or licensing terms
for an application or other software.
■ Users who are authorized to use an asset. For example, when a laptop is checked out to an employee,
the employee’s name and information is recorded in the asset management system.
■ Auditing trails. Asset management might be audited, and the system should be able to provide trails for
noncurrent activity such as who has had the laptop checked out to them since it was purchased.
● Password policy. In the module “Securing and Sharing Windows Resources,” you learn what is required to
create a strong password and best practices for passwords (for example, allowing one to expire so that the
user must occasionally change it). These requirements are sometimes documented as a password policy.
● Network topology diagrams. Network documentation should contain a map of a network’s topology, which
is called a network topology diagram. In networking, topology refers to the pattern in which devices on a
network are connected with each other. For example, devices connected in a line are using a bus topology,
and devices connected to a single, centralized device are using a star topology. As described in the module
“Networking Fundamentals,” most Ethernet networks today use a design called a star bus topology, which
means that nodes are connected to one or more centralized devices that are connected to each other
(see Figure 11-9).
A network topology diagram might show how nodes on a network are physically connected, such as
the one in Figure 11-9, or it might show the logical network topology. For example, Figure 11-10 shows the
logical connection among clients and servers to indicate how data flows among them.

On small networks, a network topology diagram can be hand drawn, but for larger networks, inventory data is usually compiled automatically through network scans. For example, Spiceworks (spiceworks.com) offers a free network
inventory product that probes devices on the network and presents a list of detected devices along with any available information, such as IP addresses, installed operating systems, and shared folders.
● Ticketing systems. One of the first systems you’ll learn to use in an IT organization is its ticketing system
used to track support calls and give technicians a place to keep their call notes. Figure 11-11 shows a window
in a popular ticketing-system application called everything HelpDesk.

When someone initiates a call for help, whoever
receives the call starts the process by creating a
ticket, which is a record of the request and what is
happening to resolve it. The ticketing system might
track (1) user information, (2) device information,
(3) description of the problems, (4) categories for tickets (for example, by incident type, deadlines, or type of problem), (5) severity of the problem or situation, (6) escalation levels, (7) who is currently assigned and who has been assigned to the ticket, and (8) clear and concise written
communication about the problem. These notes should include progress notes, who did what and when, and how
the problem was resolved.
The ticket is entered into the call tracking system and stays open until the issue is resolved. Support staff
assigned to the ticket document their progress under this ticket in the call tracking system. As an open ticket ages,
more attention and resources are assigned to it, and the ticket might be escalated until the problem is finally resolved
and the ticket closed. Help desk personnel and managers acknowledge and sometimes even celebrate those who
consistently close the most tickets!
As you support customers and solve computer problems, it’s very important to include detailed information in
your call notes so you have the information as you solve the problem or when faced with a similar problem later.
Sometimes another person must pick up your open ticket, and they should not have to waste time finding out information you already knew. Also, tracking-system notes are sometimes audited.
● Acceptable use policies. An acceptable use policy (AUP) documents a code of conduct for employees when
using corporate resources. For example, the AUP may prohibit an employee from accessing pornographic
material on company computers, using company computers and time for personal shopping, or installing
pirated software on company computers.
● Standard operating procedures. When you start in a new position, your job training will cover standard
operating procedures that detail how to function in the organization, including how to perform basic procedures such as recording your overtime hours as well as more advanced procedures such as performing
custom installations of software packages. For example, operating procedures for custom software installations might include recording the software package in the asset management system along with information
on the licensing agreement and which computers in the organization received the installation. As with many
employee tasks, it’s not so important to know all these procedures as it is to know how to find a procedure
when you need one.
● New-user setup checklist and end-user termination checklist. Carefully following the new-user setup
checklist and the end-user termination checklist is essential for good security of the resources managed by the IT department. These hardware and digital resources include the network, devices, software, and data. The checklists are likely documented among the standard operating procedures for the
IT department.
● Regulatory compliance requirements. An organization is required by law to comply with relevant laws
and other regulations. The IT department is particularly responsible to meet these regulatory compliance
requirements such as how personal identity data can be kept and used. For example, your manager might
ask you to verify that a splash screen, also called a launch screen (the first screen a user sees when they
open an app), is compliant by protecting customer data and displaying how that data can be used. On
the screen, you see the user’s email address and realize that the splash screen is not compliant. However,
the screen is compliant in that it details what happens to the user data. You learn more about regulatory
compliance in the module “Security Strategies.”

Change Management
Core 2 Objective 4.2
As an IT support technician, you will undoubtedly be involved in new projects, such as installing hardware or software, upgrading networks, moving IT operations from on-site services to cloud-based services, rolling out virtualized desktops across the organization, implementing a VoIP communication platform, and much more. A project is
temporary—it has a beginning, an end, and a singular, well-defined goal. A successful project depends on expert
project management to direct a project team through specific tasks and deliver results on time, within the agreed-to
budget, and with complete customer satisfaction.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam will give you a scenario and expect you to apply the basic principles of change management,
including documenting business processes, purpose of change, scope of change, risk analysis, end-user acceptance,
change boards, rollback plans, and the need to document change.

When a project is implemented, change happens. Change
managed well means that people affected by the change can make
a smooth transition from their current state to the project goal
or end result. In most situations, change management is closely
integrated with project management and often involves the same
teams. For example, a project manager works with a team to plan,
develop, test, and implement new software. A change manager
might work with the same team to define how the software will
affect people and manage all communication, scheduling, training, and support required so the affected people accept and
embrace the end result.
A high-level change process is diagrammed in Figure 11-12.
Know, however, that change processes vary widely. Next, we’ll look
at the basic elements of change management and how they might
relate to you as an IT support technician.
Documented Business Processes
A business is complex, and leaders of well-run organizations know
they must understand and document their core business goals
and processes. Documented business processes are related
activities that lead to a desired business goal, such as an efficient and cost-effective service, excellent customer satisfaction,
or a superior product. For example, if customer satisfaction is a
defined business goal, IT operational processes might describe
how customers are taken care of, support tickets are documented,
and customer satisfaction is measured.
As change happens, be aware of how this change affects
documented business processes. For example, suppose help
desk software is changed so the customer’s electronic signature
is required when a ticket is closed. If you forget the electronic
signature, your company may not be able to collect payment or
follow up with the customer for a satisfaction survey.

Purpose of Change
The starting point for every proposed change is a clear and concise purpose for the change. What will change? What
is the current situation and expected outcome? Why is the change needed? What happens if the organization does
not initiate this change? How will the success of the change be measured?
IT technicians often communicate with people impacted by change. Therefore, it’s important that you have a firm
understanding of the purpose for the change so you can maintain a positive, helpful attitude.
Note 6
A proposed change is formally submitted using a change request process. A change request form states what
needs to be updated or changed but does not indicate how the change will be executed. A simple change request
might require only preapproval from a manager. Complex changes, with higher impact and risks, are submitted to a
change advisory board. The change advisory board (CAB) meets on a regular basis to assess, prioritize, authorize,
and schedule changes. The change manager and other representatives approve changes based on the recommendations of the change advisory board.
Change Plan and Scope
The change plan defines the scope of change, which may outline the following:
● The purpose of the change, including key components of the change and how they will be addressed
● Skill sets, tasks, and activities required to carry out the change
● Staff member responsible for the managing the change
● Individuals or departments that will participate in the change
● Systems that will be affected by the change and the impact on those systems
● The date and possibly even the time the change will be implemented
● How the success of change is measured and when the change is completed
The scope of change defines your responsibilities in the change plan. It’s important that you understand exactly
your assignment for planning, implementing, and supporting the change and then work within these boundaries,
which is called working “in scope.” The scope of change might evolve through the feedback process of change management, but until the scope changes, it’s important to work in scope. Although it might be tempting to perform yet
one more step while implementing a change, don’t make out-of-scope modifications, which might result in major
disruption. Also, a project’s purpose might expand as the project progresses, which is sometimes called scope creep.
Too much scope creep can jeopardize the success of the entire change.
Risk Analysis
Change almost always involves risk, which refers to a problem (event, situation, or condition) that may or may not
occur as a result of the change. Possible risks include the possibility the budget is inadequate, alienating customers, not finishing on time, not delivering the intended results, the number of employees affected, and downtime for
the network or other systems. Risk analysis is the process of identifying potential risks and deciding if the risks are
worth the change.
Sometimes a numeric value or risk level from 5 (highest risk) to 1 (lowest risk) is assigned to each risk. To determine these values, each administrator affected by the potential risk may be asked to assign a risk level to that risk.
Change management software might receive all this input to calculate an overall risk level for the change.
As an IT technician, you need to be aware of the risks involved and how to execute the response plan if the
problem actually happens.
Rollback Plan
What if a change goes bad—really bad? Suppose all users lose network connectivity for hours or all database servers that log all online sales orders spontaneously crash. The rollback plan, also called the back-out plan, defines
the activities needed to recover to the original state in the event of an aborted or failed change implementation.

The rollback plan is created and sometimes tested even before the change starts, and it includes detailed steps to
restore service to users. Obviously, you need to be aware of the rollback plan prior to implementing a change.
End-User Acceptance
Recall that change management is responsible for ensuring that people impacted by change are able to make a
smooth transition during the change. End-user acceptance to change often fails because the focus of the change is
on the technical side rather than the people side. To gain end-user acceptance, users must know
1. The purpose of the change, especially the business reasons for the change
2. That the leadership of the company agrees with the change
3. How the change will affect them and their job
4. How to get their individual concerns and questions answered and how their voices will be heard
5. That they will receive end-user training for the changes that impact them. For software changes,
training often allows users to practice using the new software in a sandbox, which is an environment
in which users can practice with data and processes that don’t affect the real data and where mistakes
have little consequence. (Technicians also use sandboxes to test software to make sure it works as
designed.)
Before a change begins, an organization might request user feedback to the change in a request for comments
(RFC). Technical users often have valuable input in the RFC process that may affect the entire change process. IT
technicians often play a major role in end-user acceptance. Users who struggle with change will appreciate your
empathetic and positive outlook. When a proposed change has been clearly communicated and users understand
“what’s in it for them,” you have made a significant contribution to a successful change.
Document Changes
No part of change management should rely on spoken communication. Everything related to changes must be documented, including how the change management process itself works. Change plans are documented and updated
throughout the entire change management process. Many larger organizations use change management software,
such as ChangeGear by SunView (sunviewsoftware.com), to manage all stages of change management from the change
request form to the final close report. Smaller organizations may manually document change using Microsoft Word or
Excel documents or database software. Regardless of the size of the organization, you will be expected to maintain
proper documentation for all stages of a change in which you participate.
Working in Diverse Software Environments
Core 2 Objectives 1.8, 1.9
In the diverse world of IT, an IT support technician encounters a wide variety of hardware platforms, operating
systems, and applications. In this section, we focus on what all operating systems have in common as well as the
diversity you might encounter among operating systems.
What All Operating Systems Do
Core 2 Objective 1.8
An operating system (OS) is software that controls a computer, and all operating systems have common functions.
In general, you can think of an operating system as the middleman between applications and hardware, between the
user and hardware, and between the user and applications, as shown in Figure 11-13. (Individual components of an
OS also shown in the figure are discussed later in this module.)

Several applications might be installed on a computer to meet various user needs, but a computer really needs
only one operating system. Although there are important differences among them, all operating systems share the
following four main functions:
● Function 1: Provide a user interface
■ Performing storage and housekeeping procedures requested by the user, such as reorganizing a hard
drive and changing display settings
■ Providing a way for the user to manage the desktop, hardware, applications, and data
● Function 2: Manage files
■ Managing files on hard drives, DVD drives, CD drives, USB flash drives, and other drives
■ Creating, storing, retrieving, deleting, and moving files
● Function 3: Manage hardware
■ Interface with the BIOS/UEFI, which are programs permanently stored on hardware devices
■ Managing memory, which is a temporary place to store data and instructions as they are being processed
■ Diagnosing problems with software and hardware
■ Interfacing between hardware and software (that is, interpreting application software needs to the
hardware and vice versa)
● Function 4: Manage applications
■ Installing and uninstalling applications
■ Running applications and managing the interface to the hardware on behalf of an application
Every OS offers a command-driven interface for the user, and almost every OS also offers one or more graphical
user interface (GUI; pronounced “GOO-ee”). Workstation OSs always provide a graphical interface. Because server
computers normally have little direct human interaction, their OSs, such as Linux Ubuntu Server, don’t always
require a graphical interface. IT technicians must be comfortable using both interfaces and also supporting users
learning to use a graphical interface. The Windows graphical interface, called the desktop, is shown in Figure 11-14.
Figure 11-15 shows a command-driven interface in a Linux server.

Popular Operating Systems
Core 2 Objective 1.8
As an IT technician, you might be called on to help a customer decide which type of OS to use in a given situation.
Organizations often have a mix of several operating systems in use. The four most popular operating systems for
workstations are Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS. Here’s an overview of each OS:
● Windows by Microsoft (Microsoft.com) is the most popular workstation OS and installs on almost all desktops and laptops. The current version is Windows 11, which was an upgrade to Windows 10, which was
an upgrade to Windows 8.1, which was preceded by Windows 7. Every IT support technician needs to be a
power user of Windows.

Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam covers Windows 10 as the primary version of the Windows operating system.
● macOS by Apple (apple.com) is extremely easy to use, and its desktop interface is intuitive and beautiful.
macOS comes installed on Apple desktops and laptops. Because Apple is able to control the hardware used
by macOS, the OS is stable and reliable. Windows and macOS are the most popular OSs for workstations,
and people tend to have strong opinions about which they prefer. It often boils down to user preference
when deciding between the two OSs. Figure 11-16 shows the macOS desktop.

● Chrome OS by Google (google.com) is a relatively simple OS that works on personal devices including tablets
and laptops, called Chromebooks (see Figure 11-18), and desktops, called Chromeboxes (see Figure 11-19).
● Linux is a secure and extremely stable OS that doesn’t take up much space on the hard drive. In fact, it
takes up so little space that you install it on a USB drive and run the OS from the drive. The main advantage
of Linux is that most distributions are free. Some disadvantages to Linux are that it requires more technical knowledge to use and support it, it doesn’t have as many applications made for it as does Windows
or macOS, and it doesn’t support as many hardware peripherals. Linux comes in many distributions, also
known as distros or flavors, such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS, and Puppy Linux.

Google calls its Chromebook a Google Pixelbook. Chrome
OS apps are available from the Chrome Web Store. Chrome
OS can also run Android apps, available from Google Play.
Full applications, such as Microsoft Word, are not available for the Chrome OS. Chrome OS and its devices are
relatively inexpensive compared to other personal devices,
and they have traditionally been marketed to the education
market as a more affordable solution when heftier computing capabilities are not required.

How an OS Manages Hardware
Core 2 Objectives 1.8, 1.9
Looking back at Figure 11-13, notice that the OS kernel is the part of the OS that is responsible for relating to hardware by way of device drivers and/or firmware on the hardware. In this section, we see how both methods work.
Device Drivers
Device drivers are small programs stored on the hard drive that tell the OS how to communicate with a specific
hardware device such as a printer, network card, or scanner. These drivers are installed on the hard drive when the
OS is first installed or when new hardware is added to the system. A device driver is written to work for a specific
OS, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux.
In addition to the device drivers that are installed at the time the OS is installed, other drivers are provided by
the manufacturer of each hardware device. When you purchase a printer, video card, digital camera, scanner, or
other hardware device, a CD or DVD that contains the device drivers is usually bundled with the device along with
a user manual (see Figure 11-20). You can also download the drivers for a device from the manufacturer’s website.
Before you install a new OS, be sure you have the correct device drivers for all your critical devices, such as your
network card or motherboard.

Older CPUs processed only 32 bits at a time, but all modern CPUs process 64 bits and can handle 32-bit processing for backward compatibility with older operating systems. An operating system is also designed to process 32
or 64 bits. When selecting device drivers, make sure you choose 32-bit drivers for a 32-bit OS (a really old OS) and
64-bit drivers for a 64-bit OS (most likely situation).
Firmware on the Motherboard
The most important hardware component in a computer is the motherboard, and every motherboard has firmware
that controls it and interfaces with the OS. This firmware is stored on microchips on the board (see Figure 11-21).
When a computer is first turned on, firmware on the motherboard starts up the computer, verifies essential hardware devices (such as memory and a CPU) are present, and then starts the process of searching for and loading an
operating system.
Figure 11-21 Chips on a motherboard contain firmware used to start the computer,
hold motherboard settings, and run essential devices; the chips retain
power from a nearby coin battery when the computer is turned off
Coin battery
Firmware chips
When choosing a boot device, consider that solid-state drives are faster than magnetic hard drives because they have
no moving parts. USB flash drives are also solid-state devices. Some hard drives might be hot-swappable, which means
they are inserted into an easily accessible hot-swap bay and can be exchanged without powering down the system.
Note 7
All modern motherboards use firmware called UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). UEFI is a muchimproved replacement for BIOS (basic input/output system) and offers legacy support for BIOS compatibility. BIOS
stores its setup information on the motherboard, while UEFI stores its setup information, along with some drivers,
on the motherboard and the hard drive. The motherboard BIOS/UEFI provides three main functions:
● The system BIOS/UEFI contains instructions for running essential hardware devices before an operating
system is started. After the OS is started, it might continue to use system BIOS/UEFI or use device drivers
to communicate with these devices.
● The startup BIOS/UEFI starts the computer and finds a boot device that contains an operating system.
Boot devices that a system might support include an internal or external hard drive, a CD or DVD drive,
a bootable USB flash drive, and the network. After it finds a boot device, the firmware turns the startup
process over to the OS.

● The setup BIOS/UEFI is used to change motherboard settings. You can use it to enable or disable a device on
the motherboard (for example, the network port, video port, or USB ports), change the date and time that
is later passed to the OS, and select the order of boot devices for startup BIOS/UEFI to search when looking
for an operating system to load. This order of boot devices is called the boot priority order.
Before you learn how the boot priority order is determined, you need to know a little about how the OS manages
hard drives where the OS, applications, and data are normally stored.
How an OS Manages a Hard Drive
Core 2 Objectives 1.8, 1.9
Total capacities for today’s hard drives are measured in GB (gigabytes, roughly one million bytes) or TB (terabytes,
roughly one trillion bytes). Before a hard drive leaves the factory, a process called low-level formatting organizes
all bits into a long series of logical blocks; this is called logical block addressing (LBA). Groups of bits are referred
to as LBA 1, LBA 2, and so forth. Before an OS can use a hard drive, it first organizes these LBAs into one or more
partitions using one of two partitioning systems:
● MBR partitions. The Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system keeps a map of partitions in a partition table stored at the beginning of the hard drive called the MBR. The MBR partition table can track up to
four partitions on a drive. A drive can have one, two, or three primary partitions, also called volumes. The
fourth partition is called an extended partition and can hold one or more volumes called logical drives,
which are tracked in their own partition table separately from the primary partitions. Figure 11-22 shows
how an MBR hard drive is divided into three primary partitions and one extended partition. Because of the
limited number of bits used for the MBR, this partitioning system can handle only four partitions and up
to 2.2 TB drives.
Figure 11-22 A hard drive using the MBR partitioning system, with four partitions; the fourth

How File Systems Work
Core 2 Objective 1.8
Before a partition can be accessed, it must have a file system installed. The file system is the overall structure an
OS uses to name, store, and organize files and folders on any storage device, including hard drives. For Windows,
a hard drive partition or other storage device is assigned a drive letter (such as C: or D:) and is then called a
volume. For a hard drive with multiple partitions, each partition is a volume that must be formatted with its
own file system. See Figure 11-24. Installing a file system on a volume is called formatting the drive or high-level
formatting. This drive format can happen during the OS installation or after the OS is installed. All USB flash
drives, DVDs, smart cards, partitions on a hard drive, and other storage devices are formatted with a file system
before they can be used.
● GPT partitions. The newer Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table (GUID or GPT) partitioning system can
support up to 128 partitions and is required for drives larger than 2.2 TB. GPT requires a 64-bit operating system and UEFI firmware, and it is needed to use Secure boot, a feature of UEFI and the OS that adds security
to the boot process. Most new computers sold today use the GPT system and UEFI firmware.
The first sector of a hard drive in a GPT system contains the protective MBR, which provides information to
legacy software that doesn’t recognize GPT systems so the legacy software will not attempt to repair or install an
MBR system on the drive. GPT tracks all partitions in a single partition table, which it stores in the GPT header
immediately following the protective MBR. GPT systems also back up the partition table at the end of the disk (see
Figure 11-23).

Next, let’s see how files and directories are organized and accessed on any storage device.
Directory Hierarchical Structure of a File System
Every OS manages a storage device by using directories (a directory is also called a folder), subdirectories (also
called child directories), and files. The drive or volume is organized with a single root directory at the top of the
hierarchical structure of subdirectories, as shown in Figure 11-25 for Windows. For a Windows volume, such as
drive C:, the root directory is written as C:. Each volume has its own root directory and hierarchical structure of
subdirectories.
Any directory can have files and other subdirectories listed in it; for example, Figure 11-25 shows that one file on
drive C: is C:\Data\Business\Letter.docx. In this path to the file, the C: identifies the volume and is called the drive
letter. Drive letters used for a hard drive, CD, USB drive, or DVD are C:, D:, E:, and so forth.

The drive and directories that point to the
location of a file are called the path to the file. See
Figure 11-26 for Windows. The first part of the name
before the period is called the file name (Letter), and
the part after the period is called the file extension
(.docx). A file extension indicates how the file is organized or formatted, the type of content in the file, and
what program uses the file. For example, the .docx file
extension identifies the file type as a Microsoft Word
document file.
Linux-based OSs, including macOS, Chrome OS, and
all Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, organize their file
systems differently than does Windows. A Linux-based OS
uses a single root directory indicated by a slash (/) for
all hard drives, partitions, and other storage media. Think
of this root directory as the highest level in the hierarchy for all storage media connected to the system. See
Figure 11-27. The root contains directories—such as /home
and /etc in the figure—that hold the Linux installation and
other storage on the hard drive. The root also contains
the /media directory that is the access point to the volumes on other storage devices, such as the USB flash drive
in the figure. In Linux terms, a subdirectory in the /media directory is called the mount point for the flash drive, and
the flash drive is mounted to the system. Before a device can be mounted, it must be formatted with a file system;
therefore, in effect, the file system on the device is mounted to the system.
In Windows, the backslash is used in directory paths to
separate items in the path: C:\Data\Business\Letter.docx.
However, in macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS, the slash is
used for the same purpose: /home/user2/Business/
Letter.odt.

Compatibility between Operating Systems
Table 11-1 summarizes the types of partitioning and file systems supported by each operating system. Modern motherboards support UEFI firmware; to take advantage of this modern firmware, the hard drive must use a GPT partition
to hold the operating system used to boot the computer. For this reason, new installations of one of the OSs in the
table will not install on MBR partitions, although older installations might be using MBR. You can use MBR or GPT
on any partition or storage device that is not used for the boot.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know about the NTFS, FAT32, ext3, ext4, APFS, and exFAT file systems, including
which is appropriate to use in a given scenario.
Windows installs on an NTFS volume, but if a second volume on the drive is formatted using the FAT32 file system,
you can convert that volume to NTFS. For large drives, NTFS is more efficient, and converting might improve performance.
Note 9
In Figure 11-27, you see a USB flash drive named MyFlashUSB that has a directory named /Business, which contains a LibreOffice Writer document file MyDoc with an .odt file extension. The path to this document file is
/media/MyFlashUSB/Business/MyDoc.odt
To find any media (USB flash drive, second hard drive, DVD, and so forth), look in the /media directory to find
a subdirectory for the given media. This subdirectory (MyFlashUSB in our example) contains the contents of the
storage device.
These same hierarchical directory structures for organizing directories and files are used by all file systems.
Here is a list of file systems you are expected to know about for the A1 Core 2 exam:
● NTFS. For most editions of Windows, NTFS (New Technology File System) is required for the volume on
which Windows is installed. NTFS was designed to replace the older FAT32 file system; it is more reliable,
efficient, and secure than FAT32. NTFS supports encryption, disk quotas (limiting the hard drive space
available to a user), and file and folder compression. If you boot the system from another boot medium
such as a DVD, you can access a volume using a FAT file system. If the volume uses NTFS, an administrator
password is required to gain access.
● FAT32. Use FAT32 for small hard drives or USB flash drives because it does not have as much overhead as
NTFS, and it is supported by macOS, Linux, Chrome OS, and other OSs. FAT32 uses 32 bits to address each
unit of data on the volume.
● exFAT. Choose the exFAT file system for large external storage devices that you want to use with other operating systems. For example, you can use a smart card formatted with exFAT in a Mac or Linux computer or
in a digital camcorder, camera, or smartphone. The exFAT file system uses the same structure as the older
FAT32, but with a 64-bit-wide file allocation table (FAT). exFAT does not use as much overhead as the NTFS
file system and is designed to handle very large files, such as those used for multimedia storage.
● ext3. The file system ext3 (third extended file system) was invented by Linux developers and was the
first to support journaling, which is a technique that tracks and stores changes to the hard drive and helps
prevent file system corruption.
● ext4. The current Linux file system is ext4 (fourth extended file system), which is used by default when
the OS is installed and another file system is not in place. It improved on ext3 with better performance and
support for larger volumes. Similar to FAT32 and exFAT, ext3 used 32-bit addressing and ext4 uses 64-bit
addressing, thus allowing for larger volumes.
● APFS. APFS (Apple File System) is the default file system for macOS. APFS allows multiple volumes on a
single partition and can allocate free space as needed for each volume in the partition. In Apple terminology,
a partition is sometimes called a container. APFS requires the GPT (also called GUID) partitioning system.
APFS is compatible with the older Mac OS Extended file system, also called HFS1 (Hierarchical File System
Plus), but it is not compatible with some earlier versions of macOS.

Table 11-2 OS primary tools and commands to manage hard drives
You can also use third-party drivers to allow an OS that does not support a particular file system to read data on
a computer using that file system. For example, Paragon Software (paragon-software.com) offers APFS for Windows,
which installs in Windows to read/write to APFS partitions on macOS computers on the network.
Table 11-2 summarizes the tools and commands each OS uses to manage hard drives. Because macOS and
Chrome OS are both built on a Linux foundation, they have some commands in common, as you will see in later
modules when we cover several tools and commands.
Types of OS Installations and Upgrades
Core 2 Objective 1.9
An IT technician is often involved in installing, upgrading, and repairing an operating system. When it’s time to install
or upgrade any OS you support, you’ll need to understand what type of installation you are performing, how the
installation begins, and where the OS installation files are stored. All these topics are covered next.
Clean Install, Upgrade, or Repair
If you are installing an OS on a new hard drive, you must perform a clean install. If an OS is already installed on the
hard drive, you have three choices:
● Clean install. You can perform a clean install, overwriting the existing operating system and applications. For
Windows, the setup program calls a clean install a custom installation. The main advantage of a clean install
is that problems with the old OS are not carried forward, and you get a fresh start. During the installation,
you will have the option to reformat the hard drive, erasing everything on it. If you don’t format the drive,
data will still be on it. After the OS is installed, you will need to install third-party drivers and applications.

■ macOS upgrade. The latest edition of macOS is macOS Monterey. You can download and install a
free upgrade if your Apple computer hardware qualifies for the OS. If you’re currently running macOS
Mojave or later, you can start the upgrade from System Preferences. If you’re running an older version
of macOS, use the App Store to start the upgrade. To know which OS is installed, click the apple,
click About This Mac, and then select the Overview tab. You can also upgrade from this window. See
Figure 11-28. A macOS upgrade takes a long time, and the system reboots several times, but you don’t
need to interact with the installation.

Table 11-3 In-place upgrade paths to Windows 10
A 64-bit version of Windows can only be upgraded to a 64-bit OS. A 32-bit OS can only be upgraded to a 32-bit OS. If
you want to install a 64-bit version of Windows on a computer that already has a 32-bit OS installed, you must perform
a clean install.
Note 11
For a Windows clean install, the previous Windows settings and user profiles are collectively stored in the Windows.
old folder that setup creates on the hard drive. After you’re sure the new installation is working as expected, you can
delete the Windows.old folder to save space on the drive. Windows automatically deletes most of the content of this
folder 10 days after the installation.
Note 10
● Upgrade. If the upgrade path allows it and the OS is healthy enough, you can perform an upgrade installation. An upgrade is always started from within the existing operating system. Launch the OS and then
launch the upgrade process. The upgrade carries forward user settings and installed applications from the
old OS to the new one. An upgrade is faster than a clean install and is appropriate if the system is generally
healthy and does not have problems. Before you start an upgrade, be sure to back up data stored on the
hard drive. Here’s the breakdown of how to start an upgrade for each OS:
■ Windows upgrade. Windows calls an upgrade an in-place upgrade because the old OS is already
in place. To perform an in-place upgrade, Microsoft requires that certain editions and versions of
Windows are already installed and running the latest version of either Windows 8.1 or Windows 7
with Service Pack 1 installed. These qualifying OSs are called upgrade paths. Table 11-3 outlines the
acceptable upgrade paths for Windows 10 compatibility. To upgrade from an earlier edition of Windows
to Windows 10, you’ll need to purchase the product key from the Microsoft Store and download the
installation files. To start a Windows in-place upgrade, launch Windows and follow the procedures you
learn about in the module “Installing Windows” to perform the upgrade.

● Repair. Each OS has various tools and commands you can use to repair a corrupted installation, which
you learn about in later modules. For laptop computers and brand name desktops, sometimes the hard
drive contains a recovery partition that can be used to restore the computer back to its state when first
purchased. How to use this partition is covered in the module “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”
Figure 11-29 Use the Chrome OS Settings to update the OS
■ Linux upgrade. When you first log on to Linux, a list of available updates displays. To apply these
updates, you use the apt-get and do-release-upgrade commands. How to use these commands is
covered in the module “Linux and Scripting.” Linux updates are free.
■ Chrome OS upgrade. To upgrade to the latest Chrome OS, in the Settings app, open About Chrome OS, and
click Check for updates. See Figure 11-29. If updates are available, they start to download automatically.

Boot Methods
To perform a clean install, upgrade, or some OS repairs, you’ll need the installation files provided by the OS manufacturer. In most cases, you download these files from the manufacturer website and store them on a device such
as a USB solid-state flash drive or solid-state external hard drive, optical media (DVD), the network, and external or
internal hot-swappable hard drive, or a second partition on the main internal hard drive. Sometimes you can perform
the installation without downloading all files first, as the setup program can access files stored online.
For a new or corrupted hard drive, the storage device holding the installation files must be bootable, which
means it can be accessed by BIOS/UEFI to launch an operating system. After the OS is running, it then launches the
setup program to install the new OS. In later modules, you learn how to make this installation media bootable for
each OS.
Selecting the Boot Priority Order
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.8
To boot from a media other than the hard drive, you can use BIOS/UEFI setup to change the boot priority order. See
the motherboard documentation to find out how to access and use BIOS/UEFI setup. Here are steps for one system:
1. Insert your bootable media, such as the DVD in the optical drive or a USB flash drive in a USB port.
2. To access BIOS/UEFI setup, press a key such as Del or F2 early in the boot process before the OS starts to
load. When the BIOS/UEFI setup screen appears, look for a screen to manage the boot. For example, the
Boot screen for one motherboard’s firmware is shown in Figure 11-30.
Applying Concepts
Figure 11-30 The Boot screen for BIOS/UEFI setup
3. Normally, BIOS/UEFI is set to boot first from the internal hard drive. To boot from another device, look for
a Boot screen or menu. For the system shown in Figure 11-31, boot options are the DVD drive, hard drive,
and network port. Also, know that sometimes the DVD drive is labeled CD-ROM in BIOS/UEFI setup. Source: American Megatrends, Inc.

4. Make your change and then use the Exit menu to save your changes and restart the system. The system
should restart and look to your bootable media to launch an OS. Then the setup program on your
bootable media should launch.
In a corporate or enterprise environment, automated methods might be in place to install a fresh copy of the OS
on a workstation from deployment servers on the network. To use this method, you configure BIOS/UEFI setup to
boot from the network and locate a deployment server to install the OS. How to do that is covered in the next module.
In most situations, you use the GPT partitioning system for the hard drive. If you must use the MBR system,
in BIOS/UEFI setup, change the mode to CSM (Compatibility Support Mode), which supports MBR.
Note 12
Vendor End-of-Life Limitation and Product Life Cycle
Core 2 Objective 1.8
In practice, computers and their operating systems might stay in service long after manufacturer support for the
OS has ended. However, it’s important that you know when an OS will no longer be supported by its manufacturer
and what to expect during the life cycle of the product. Here is the rundown:
● Windows. In the past, Microsoft released a new version of Windows about every three years, but with
Windows 10, it seems to be extending the life of a Windows version by providing incremental feature
updates to the OS, called Windows as a Service (WaaS). Windows 10 has been the current Windows version since 2015, and Windows 11 is scheduled to be released near the beginning of 2022. Feature updates,
which are incremental releases of new versions of Windows 10, happen about every six months, and minor
security and nonsecurity updates happen weekly. Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are no longer supported or
updated by Microsoft. It is expected that Windows 10 will be supported long after Windows 11 is released.

Get to Know the Chrome OS
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.8
We end this module with a quick look at the Chrome OS. In later
modules, you learn about Windows, macOS, Linux, and also iOS
and Android, the two most popular mobile operating systems.
Chrome OS is deeply integrated with Google’s Chrome
browser: Most of Chrome OS’s native apps open directly in the
Chrome browser and rely heavily on having an active Internet
connection. While there are some apps that will function offline—
such as Gmail, Docs, and Calendar—functionality is limited to
data that is temporarily stored on the Chromebook until it can
again be synced with the user’s online account. Chrome OS functions exclusively on Chromebooks and Chomeboxes, although
many manufacturers build and sell these laptops, tablets, and
desktops. See Figure 11-32.
First Look at a Chromebook
Chromebooks and Chromeboxes come with a variety of external
ports, depending on the manufacturer and model. Many feature
USB and USB-C ports as well as HDMI. Some include SD card slots for adding extra storage space. The keyboard on
a Chromebook (see Figure 11-33) looks similar to the typical laptop keyboard, with a few notable differences. The
unique keys mostly run along the top of the keyboard and include these keys: search, previous and next pages,
refresh, immersive mode (hides tabs and launcher), and overview mode (shows all open apps). Keyboard shortcuts,
a popular feature with Chromebooks, use combinations of key presses to accomplish tasks such as opening a new
Chrome window (ctrl1n) or tab (ctrl1t), taking a screenshot (ctrl1overview), locking the screen (search1L), and
showing all keyboard shortcuts (ctrl1alt1/).
Applying Concepts
Figure 11-32 A Chromebook can be

a tablet, or a hybrid
laptop-tablet
● macOS. Over the past 20 years, Apple has released versions of Mac OS X about once a year; it was renamed
macOS in 2016. The OS version a Mac can support depends on the age of the Mac. For example, a MacPro
made in 2013 or later should support Big Sur, a current macOS release, and a MacBook Air made in 2015 or
later should support Monterey, the latest macOS release. Apple releases updates to the current OSs about
every two to three months. Each version of macOS is supported with security updates for about three years
after its release.
● Linux. How long a Linux distribution is supported depends on the developer. For example, Canonical (canonical.com), which makes Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server, releases a new distribution of Ubuntu about
every two years and provides support of that release for about five years.
● Chrome OS. Google releases a complete Chrome OS update about every six weeks. Minor updates are
released about every two or three weeks. Because Chrome OS is a relatively new OS, the updates are less
regular than more mature OSs, and sometimes the updates have significant bugs. For best results, keep
automatic updates turned on.

Google apps are deeply integrated into the Chrome OS experience. Figure 11-34 shows the Chrome OS desktop with
the Settings app, Chrome browser, and Notification Tray open. Also notice the shelf on the bottom and the status
tray on the bottom right of the screen. The app launcher is in the shelf. To open the Settings app, click anywhere
in the status tray, which opens the Notification tray, and then click the Settings app gear icon, which is labeled in

Chrome OS includes some significant security measures to protect the computer from malware, including builtin virus protection. Google took a four-pronged approach to security with Chrome OS:
Sandboxing. To help secure the system, each tab in the Chrome browser is isolated from the underlying OS
and from processes in other tabs.
Verified boot. Similar to the Windows Secure boot, it protects the OS from changes being made to its
underlying system files, automatically entering recovery mode if modifications are detected.

Power washing. The user can perform a simple and quick reset to factory settings in the event a malware
infection does manage to take hold or the system otherwise becomes unstable. To start a power wash,
press Ctrl1Alt1Shift1r, select Restart, and then click Powerwash. All data on the hard drive is lost in a power wash.
Quick updates. The OS updates itself in the background without user intervention about every six weeks. If an
update is needed for a security patch, it can happen within 48 hours.
The end effect is a very stable and secure OS that even security professionals rely on when traveling to techie,
hacker, or security conferences, where the persistent threat of hacking attacks is an integral part of the overall
experience.
Chrome OS Apps
The Chrome OS shelf contains icons for important apps; tap an icon to open the app. To view and open any
installed app, tap the app launcher icon in the shelf (refer back to Figure 11-34), and tap an app in the launcher
(see Figure 11-35). Most apps open in the Chrome browser, and several apps offer Chrome extensions that add
functionality to the Chrome browser even when the app is not open. Users can get more apps through the Chrome
Web Store app, or they can download Android apps through the Google Play Store app.
Applying Concepts Continued
Caution
Know that if you download Android apps to the Chromebook and then turn off the Play Store app, you’ll lose
all the Android apps’ data and settings from the Chromebook.

Module Summary
What Customers Want: Beyond Technical Know-How
● Customers want more than just technical know-how. They want a positive and helpful attitude, respect, good
communication, sensitivity to their needs, ownership of their problem, dependability, credibility, integrity,
honesty, and professionalism.
● Customers expect their first contact with you to be professional and friendly, and they expect that your first
priority will be listening to their problem or request.
● Know how to ask penetrating questions when interviewing a customer about a problem or request.
● Set and meet customer expectations by using good communication about what you are doing or intending
to do and by allowing the customer to make decisions where appropriate.
● Dress professionally and match your attire to the requirements of your environment.
● Deal confidently and gracefully with customers who are difficult, including those who are not knowledgeable,
are overly confident, or complain.
● When you first start a new job, find out how to escalate a problem you cannot solve.
Documentation and Support Systems
● Expect to find documentation in an IT environment about knowledge bases, asset management, password policies, network topology diagrams, ticketing systems, acceptable use policy, standard operating
procedures, new-user and end-user termination checklists, regulatory compliance requirements, and the
documentation needed for change management.
● Change management includes identifying the purpose and scope of change, developing a change plan,
performing risk analysis, creating a rollback plan, getting approval from a change board, acquiring end-user
acceptance, and documenting the entire change process.
Working in Diverse Software Environments
● An operating system manages hardware, runs applications, provides an interface for users, and stores,
retrieves, and manipulates files.
● Popular operating systems for workstations are Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS.
● An OS interfaces with hardware via device drivers and firmware on the device.
● Motherboard firmware includes BIOS and UEFI, which together control the startup process and interface
with components on the motherboard.
● A hard drive contains one or more partitions or volumes and can use the MBR or GPT partitioning system.
Using GPT requires UEFI firmware and a 64-bit OS. Drives larger than 2.2 TB must use GPT.
● A file system is installed on storage devices to name, store, and organize files and folders on the device.
● File systems include NTFS, FAT32, exFAT, ext3, ext4, and APFS. Windows installs on the NTFS file system;
MacOS installs on APFS, and Linux and Chrome OS install on ext4. FAT32 file system can be used by all these
OSs to read and write data.
● An operating system can be installed as a clean installation or an in-place upgrade; sometimes an OS can
be repaired without being reinstalled.
● An OS can be installed from the installation files stored on a USB solid-state flash drive or solid-state external hard drive, optical media (DVD), the network, and external or internal hot-swappable hard drive, or a
second partition on the main internal hard drive.
● To boot the system from a media other than the primary hard drive, you can use BIOS/UEFI setup to change
the boot priority order.
● When supporting an OS, you need to understand the product life cycle and the vendor’s end-of-life limitation for the product.

Real Problems, Real Solutions
Using Windows Help and Support
Est. Time: 20 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.8
The best IT support technicians are the ones who continually teach themselves new skills. You can teach yourself
to use and support Windows by using the web and a couple of apps in Windows 10 called Get Help and Tips. To
start the apps in Windows 10, type get help in the search box or type tips in the search box. If you are connected
to the Internet, clicking links in either of these two apps will take you to the Microsoft website, where you can find
information and watch videos about Windows.
Do the following to research a topic to help you become an independent learner about Windows:
1. The Windows 10 Snipping Tool can help you take screenshots of the Windows desktop. These screenshots
are useful when documenting computer problems and solutions. Use Get Help or Windows Help and
Support to find out how to use the Snipping Tool, and then use it to take a screenshot of your Windows
desktop. Save the screenshot into a file on a USB flash drive or on the hard drive. Print the file contents.
2. Access the support.microsoft.com website for Windows support. Save or print one article from the
Knowledge Base that addresses a problem when installing Windows 10.
3. Search the web to learn the purpose of the pagefile.sys file. What website did you use to find your answer?
Why is the Microsoft website considered the best source for information about the pagefile.sys file?

Introduction
In this module, you learn how to evaluate a computer and its network so you can plan and perform a Windows installation in various scenarios. You also learn what to do after the OS is installed and what to expect when installing
Windows on computers in a large enterprise.
Evaluating a System for Windows 10 or
Windows 11
Core 2 Objectives 1.1, 1.3, 1.7
As an IT support technician, you can expect to be called on to install Windows in a variety of situations. You might
need to install Windows on a new hard drive, after an existing Windows installation has become corrupted, or
to upgrade from one OS to another. One decision you might be called on to make is which edition and version of
Windows is needed; this partly depends on how the computer accesses resources on the network. You also need
to verify that the computer hardware and applications qualify for Windows 10 or Windows 11. These concerns
are all covered next, first for Windows 10 and then for Windows 11.
Choose a Windows 10 Edition
Core 2 Objective 1.1
Microsoft offers several editions of Windows 10. For all editions, the desktop styles and user interface work much
the same way. The differences involve the additional features supported by each edition:
● Windows 10 Home edition is intended for laptops and desktop computers in a home or small office. This
edition is less expensive than others because it does not include the features required for a corporate or
enterprise environment.
● Windows 10 Pro edition adds to Windows 10 Home edition several features designed for work in a corporate
setting. The most important features are as follows:
■ Domain access. In a home or small office setting, each computer on the network connects in a
workgroup. If the computer connects to a corporate or educational network to access network
resources, it requires access to a Windows domain, which manages resources on the network. More
differences between a workgroup and a domain are covered later in this module.
■ BitLocker. BitLocker encrypts an entire volume on a drive to protect the data and can provide full hard
drive encryption. This level of security is often required by corporations to secure a computer, its data, and
its settings before the computer is allowed to connect to and access resources on a corporate network.
■ Encryption File System (EFS). EFS encrypts files and folders to protect the data. Although not as
secure as full drive encryption, EFS is sometimes required by individuals and corporations to protect
the data on a computer’s hard drive.
■ Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). RDP is a networking protocol used by two applications embedded
in Windows Pro: Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance. You learn how to use both in a later module.
■ Support for additional memory. Windows Home supports up to 128 GB of memory (also called
random access memory or RAM). Windows Pro supports up to 2 TB of RAM.
Exam Tip
Windows 10 is the primary Windows version covered on the A+ Core 2 exam. The exam has light coverage of Windows 11.
When a Windows objective does not specify Windows 10, Windows 10 and 11 are assumed. In this and later modules, we
focus on Windows 10 and also give light coverage of Windows 11. Previous versions of Windows, including Windows 8.1 and
Windows 7 are no longer supported by Microsoft and are not covered in this text.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
■ Local Group Policy. Group Policy (command name is gpedit.msc) is used by Windows Server in a
Windows domain to control what users and computers can do on the network. The Windows Pro
Local Group Policy is an administrator tool that can be used to control the local user and workstation
activities. You learn how to use Group Policy in the module “Securing and Sharing Windows Resources.”
■ Hyper-V. Hyper-V is a Windows hypervisor that allows you to create and use virtual machines in
Windows Pro. You learn to use Hyper-V later in this module.
● Windows 10 Pro for Workstations edition adds to the Windows 10 Pro edition these features to improve
performance:
■ The Resilient File System (ReFS) improves on the NTFS file system with enhanced performance and
improved fault tolerance to better protect data from corruption. It also works better with virtualization
and RAID systems.
■ SMB Direct, which is also used by Windows Server, improves performance when sharing files on the
network. SMB (Server Message Block) is a protocol used to share files on a network.
■ Persistent Memory (PMem) is a memory technology that retains its contents even when power is
turned off and is faster than normal memory when interfacing with solid-state storage devices.
■ Windows 10 Pro for Workstations supports up to 6 TB of RAM and up to four CPUs.
● Windows 10 Enterprise edition allows for volume licensing and additional security features, including the
following:
■ Windows Defender Credential Guard better secures credentialing information, such as encryption
secrets used with passwords.
■ Endpoint detection and response can collect up to six months of information about suspicious
activities to help technicians better understand past, active, and potential security threats.
■ Unified Write Filter (UWF) intercepts and redirects to a temporary location any suspicious writes to
storage devices.
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to be able to compare and contrast versions and editions of Windows and determine
which is best in a given scenario in personal, small business, and enterprise environments.
Choose a Windows 11 Edition
Core 2 Objective 1.1
Just as with Windows 10, Windows 11 comes in Windows 11 Home, Pro, Pro for Workstations, and Enterprise editions. Here are the significant differences between Windows 11 Home and Pro:
● Windows 11 Pro features. Like Windows 10 Pro, Windows 11 Pro offers features not included in Windows
11 Home, including BitLocker, Hyper-V, Microsoft Remote Desktop, MDM, Group Policy, capacity for more
RAM, and support for joining Active Directory and Azure AD.
● Windows 11 Home limitations. Windows 11 Home requires an Internet connection, and a Microsoft account
is required for installation. (After the installation, however, you can remove the Microsoft account from
Windows 11 Home.) Windows 11 Pro, just as with Windows 10, can be installed with a local account and
without Internet access.
32-Bit versus 64-Bit Version
Core 2 Objective 1.7
Recall that an operating system can process 32 bits or 64 bits at a time. A 64-bit installation of Windows 10/11
generally performs better than a 32-bit installation if you have enough RAM. Table 12-1 shows how much RAM is
supported by popular editions of Windows. Also, 64-bit installations of Windows can support 64-bit applications,

All processors (CPUs) used in personal computers today are hybrid processors and can handle a 32-bit or 64-bit OS.
However, the Intel Itanium and Xeon processors used in high-end workstations and servers are true 64-bit processors
and require a 64-bit OS.
Note 1
The amount of memory or RAM you can install in a computer depends not only on the OS installed but also on how
much memory the motherboard can hold. To know how much RAM a motherboard can support, see the motherboard
documentation.
Note 2
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam may give you a scenario and ask you to demonstrate hardware compatibility requirements for a
Windows installation.
Verify That Your System Qualifies for Windows 10
Core 2 Objectives 1.1, 1.3
Before you purchase Windows 10, verify that all the applications installed on the system will work with Windows 10.
Windows 10 is backward compatible with most applications written for Windows 8/7. You also need to make sure
the computer meets the minimum hardware requirements:
● Processor (CPU): 1 GHz or faster
● RAM: 1 GB for a 32-bit OS or 2 GB for a 64-bit OS
● Free space on hard drive: 16 GB for a 32-bit OS or 20 GB for a 64-bit OS
● Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with a WDDM 1.0 driver
● Display: 800 × 600 resolution
Recall that hardware devices require device drivers to interface with Windows. Look at all the hardware components and peripherals (graphics cards, printers, and even the motherboard) to verify Windows 10 device drivers
are available. Download important ones, such as the drivers for the network card, before you install Windows. It’s
very important to have a Windows 10 driver for your network port without having to depend on the network or the
Internet to get one after Windows 10 is installed. Also know that many Windows 8/7 drivers work with Windows 10.
Operating System 32-Bit Architecture 64-Bit Architecture
Windows Home 4 GB 128 GB
Windows Pro 4 GB 2 TB
Windows Pro for Workstations 4 GB 6 TB
Windows Enterprise 4 GB 6 TB
Table 12-1 Maximum memory supported by Windows 10/11 editions and versions
which run faster than 32-bit apps. Even though you can install 32-bit applications in a 64-bit OS, always choose 64-bit
applications for best performance. Keep in mind that 64-bit installations of Windows require 64-bit device drivers.
Also note that a 64-bit version of Windows can only be upgraded to a 64-bit OS. A 32-bit OS can only be upgraded
to a 32-bit OS. If you want to install a 64-bit version of Windows on a computer that already has a 32-bit OS installed,
you must perform a clean install.

In general, it’s best not to upgrade an OS on a laptop unless you want to use some feature the new OS offers. For laptops, follow the general rule, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Many hardware components in a laptop are proprietary, and
the laptop manufacturer is the only source for those drivers. If you are considering upgrading a laptop to Windows 10,
check the laptop manufacturer’s website for advice and to download Windows 10 drivers, which are called third-party
drivers because they are not included in BIOS/UEFI or Windows.
Note 3
Figure 12-1 Use the System Information utility to examine details about a system
For a laptop or brand-name computer, check with the computer manufacturer to make sure the specific computer model you are working with supports Windows 10.
System Requirements for Windows 11
Core 2 Objectives 1.1, 1.3
As announced by Microsoft, the hardware requirements for Windows 11 are designed to limit computers that qualify
for Windows 11 to those that are less than four years old. The requirements for a computer to qualify for Windows 11
are the same for Home and Pro editions:
● Processor. The processor must have two cores and a minimum speed of 1 GHz. In addition, Microsoft recommends specific Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm processors that are less than four years old. For Intel, that
includes 8th generation processors released in 2017 or later.
System Information Window
Core 2 Objective 1.3
To get useful details about what hardware and OS is currently installed in your system, open the System Information
window (msinfo32.exe). To run System Information in Windows, enter msinfo32 in the search box. The System
Information window for one computer is shown in Figure 12-1. To drill down to more information in the window,
click items in the left pane.

Recall from the module “The Complex World of IT Professionals” that the diagrams in Figure 12-2 and later in Figure 12-3
describe the logical connections between computers, which is called logical network topology, as opposed to the
physical topology.
Note 4
Understanding How Windows
Supports Networking
Core 2 Objectives 1.1, 1.6, 2.5
To help you decide which edition of Windows 10 or Windows 11 to use and understand how Windows will connect
to a network and its resources using the installation, you need to know a little about Windows networking. Recall
that Windows computers can connect to a local network in a workgroup or a domain. In addition, computers connected anywhere on the Internet can share resources by using Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. All three methods
are described next.
Windows Workgroup
Core 2 Objectives 1.1, 1.6
A network that doesn’t have centralized control, such as one in a small office or home office (SOHO), is called a
peer-to-peer (P2P) network, which Windows calls a workgroup. A workgroup is a logical group of computers and
users that share resources (see Figure 12-2), where administration, resources, and security on a workstation are
controlled by that workstation.
Caution
If a processor is not on the Microsoft recommended list, but still has two cores and a minimum speed of 1 GHz speed,
and the TPM chip is version 1.3 or later, the computer might still install Windows 11, but Microsoft has announced it will
not guarantee such a system will receive Windows 11 updates, including security updates. If you do install Windows 11
on a system that does not qualify for it, don’t trust it with important or sensitive data, because it might be vulnerable
to attack without all the security updates.
● Memory. At least 4 GB RAM.
● Storage. At least 64 GB.
● Security. UEFI firmware with secure boot enabled, and a version 2.0 TPM chip on the motherboard.
● Upgrade paths. Currently, you can upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 for free. You can also upgrade
for free from Windows 7/8 to Windows 11, although apps and settings might not make it through the upgrade.
For Windows 7/8 systems, you might want to first upgrade to Windows 10 and then upgrade Windows 10
to Windows 11. However, know that computers that are old enough to have Windows 7/8 installed as the
original OS are most likely not going to qualify for Windows 11.

Windows Domain
Core 2 Objectives 1.1, 1.6
A Windows domain is implemented on a larger, private network, such as a corporate or college network. The domain
forms a logical group of networked computers that share a centralized directory database of user account information and security (see Figure 12-3). A Windows domain is a type of client/server network, which is a network where
resources are managed by centralized computers. A computer making a request from another is called the client,

single computer controls the network and each computer controls its
own resources

Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to be able to contrast a workgroup and domain and know which to use in a given
scenario.
In a Windows workgroup, each computer maintains a list of users and their rights on that particular computer.
The computer can share its resources with others on the network by creating share permissions for its files, folders,
and connected devices, such as a printer.

Active Directory
Windows Server controls a network using the directory database called Active Directory (AD). All users on the
network must have their own domain-level account, the most common of which is called a domain user account
or network ID. These accounts are kept in AD and assigned by the network or system administrator. If you are connecting a computer to a domain, the administrator will tell you the network ID and password to the domain that you
can use to sign in to the network. AD normally manages a domain for users on company premises. Remote users can
join the domain using a VPN or DirectAccess connection. A virtual private network (VPN) is a security technique
that encrypts data transmitted between a private network and a computer somewhere on the Internet. Windows
DirectAccess was designed to eliminate the need for a VPN.
Windows Home does not support joining a domain. If you plan to join a domain on your network, install Windows 10/11
Pro or Enterprise editions. Chrome OS, Linux, and macOS can all join a domain.

and the computer answering the request is called the server. Using the client/server model, the directory database
is controlled by a network operating system (NOS). Examples of network operating systems are Windows Server
and various forms of Linux such as Ubuntu Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

If your computer is part of a domain, press Ctrl+Alt+Del when Windows starts to display a sign-in screen, and then
enter your network ID and password.
Note 6
Connecting a Computer to a Windows Domain
If a Windows computer is already connected to a physical network, you have signed in to Windows with a local user
account, and you want to access resources controlled by a Windows domain on the network, you’ll need to change
the way Windows connects to the network. To make the change, you’ll need the network ID and password to the
domain provided by the network administrator. Do the following:
1. Open the Settings app. Open the Accounts group, and then click Access work or school.
2. Under Access work or school, click Connect. See Figure 12-4 for Windows 10; Windows 11 works the same way.
Chrome OS, Linux, and macOS can also connect to a Windows domain. You learn to do that in later modules.
Azure Active Directory
Core 2 Objective 1.6
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD) manages users in the cloud and creates a virtual network of users
connected through the Internet. Whereas AD is managed by Windows Server installed on private computers on
company premises, Azure AD runs in the cloud from more than 200 Microsoft data centers around the world that
offer Azure AD as a public service. See Figure 12-5. This method is primarily intended as a way for work-owned
devices to access cloud resources, such as Office 365, from anywhere on the Internet. For example, a company
3. Click Join this device to a local Active Directory domain. Enter the domain name and click Next. Follow
the on-screen directions. The next time you sign in to Windows, use your network ID on the domain.

might provide company-owned laptops so its sales force working from many remote locations can access company
resources in the cloud. Azure AD uses Microsoft account email addresses as account names. Windows 10/11 Pro
and Enterprise editions allow work-owned devices and personal devices to join Azure AD. Windows 10/11 Home
does not support Azure AD.
Microsoft calls joining a personal device to Azure AD the BYOD experience (bring your own device experience).
When a personal device joins Azure AD, you can access corporate resources, such as corporate databases, while
still accessing personal resources, such as your personal OneDrive. The process works by using a personal account
to sign in to Windows, followed by a secondary sign-in to authenticate to Azure AD. A school might use the BYOD
experience to allow students to access school resources using their personal devices via the Internet.
To authenticate to Azure Active Directory, make sure you’re connected to the Internet, and do the following:
1. Open the Settings app. Open the Accounts group, and then click Access work or school.
2. Under Access work or school, click Connect. (Refer back to Figure 12-4.)
3. Do one of the following:
● For an Azure AD join, click Join this device to Azure Active Directory. Enter the email address for the
work or school account you are accessing and click Next. Follow the on-screen directions. The next
time you sign in to Windows, use the same email address.
● For the BYOD experience, enter your Azure AD email address and click Next. Follow the on-screen
directions. You will then have access to organizational resources using SSO (single sign-on) as well
as access to your personal resources, such as your personal OneDrive. The next time you sign in to
Windows, use your personal account. You will automatically be signed in to Azure AD.

A Microsoft account is an example of a single sign-on (SSO) account, which accesses multiple, independent resources,
systems, or applications after you sign in one time to one account.
Note 7
Types of User Accounts
Core 2 Objective 2.5
To help keep it all straight, let’s pause and summarize the three types of user accounts and how each is used:
● Local account. A local account is created on the local computer and is recognized only on the local computer. A local account is authenticated on the local computer.
● Network ID. Professional and enterprise editions of Windows allow a user to sign in to Windows with a
network ID and password that are created and maintained on a Windows domain in Active Directory on the
local network.

Table 12-2 Types of accounts and types of authentications
Besides authenticating to the local computer, a network, or a cloud, any one of the three types of Windows
accounts can be assigned a privilege level that apply to what the account is allowed to do on the local computer:
● A standard account has fewer privileges and is used for normal productivity work on a computer.
● An administrator account has more privileges than a standard account and is used by people responsible
for maintaining and securing the system.
Next, let’s look at the different ways that Windows handles public and private network connections.
Public and Private Networks
Core 2 Objective 1.6
When you connect a Windows computer to a network the first time, Windows asks how you want to secure the network connection. When connecting to a public network, such as when you connect your laptop to a public wireless
network at a local airport, you always want to ensure that your computer is protected from outside hackers and
malware. Windows 10/11 offers three ways to secure a network connection:
● Public network. When using Public network security, Windows configures strong firewall settings, the
computer is hidden from other devices on the network, and you can’t share files or printers. This option is
the most secure.
● Private network. When using Private network security, the computer is discoverable and you can share
files and printers. Windows 10/11 computers can join a workgroup.
● Domain network. When the computer is set up to join a Windows domain, it yields control for authenticating users and sharing files, folders, and printers to settings in Active Directory.
If you want to change the setting that controls how Windows secures a network connection, open the Network
and Sharing Center, and click Change advanced sharing settings. In the Advanced sharing settings window (see
Figure 12-6), you can change the public, private, home, or work status of a network connection, and you can turn
network discovery and file and printer sharing on or off. You learn how to manage all these settings in the module
“Network Security and Troubleshooting.”
● Microsoft account. A Microsoft account is an email address initially set up at the Microsoft website (live.
com). It gives you access to the Microsoft OneDrive cloud and several types of online accounts, including
Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Skype, and Outlook.com. In addition, if you have an account in Azure Active
Directory given to you by your school or other organization, you use your Microsoft account to authenticate to these domain services in the cloud. As you learn later in the module, Microsoft makes every effort
to encourage you to use a Microsoft account in Windows. In fact, Windows 11 Home requires you to have a
Microsoft account to install the OS.
Table 12-2 summarizes the various ways to sign in to Windows, access Microsoft resources in the cloud, and join
a domain. (Note that it is possible for a network administrator to configure Windows Server to associate a Microsoft
account to a network ID so sign-in to the domain can be done with a Microsoft account.)

Before getting into the step-by-step instructions for installing an OS, here are some general tips for installing Windows:
● Verify that you have all application software CDs or DVDs available and all third-party device drivers.
● Back up all important data on the drive. How to perform backups is covered in the module “Maintaining
Windows.” It’s especially important to back up user data and preferences.
● For upgrade installations and clean installs in which you do not plan to reformat the hard drive, run antivirus/anti-malware software to make sure the drive is free of malware. After you have scanned for malware, if
you still suspect malware is present, perform a clean installation of Windows.
● If Windows is giving errors or refuses to start, perform a clean installation.
● If you want to begin the installation by booting from the Windows USB flash drive or DVD, use BIOS/UEFI
setup to verify that the boot sequence is first USB or the optical drive, and then the hard drive.
● In BIOS/UEFI setup, disable any virus protection setting that prevents the boot area of the hard drive from
being altered.
● Set BIOS/UEFI to use UEFI mode (which uses GPT and possibly Secure boot) or UEFI CSM mode (which uses
MBR partitions on the hard drive). Know that Windows 10 will install on a GPT drive only when CSM mode is
disabled and will install on an MBR drive only when CSM mode is enabled. As you learn later in the module,
Windows 11 installs only when Secure boot is enabled.
● For a laptop computer, connect the AC adapter and use that power source for the complete OS installation,
updates, and installation of hardware and applications. You don’t want the battery to fail in the middle of
the installation.
The Size of the Windows Partition
Core 2 Objective 1.9
For a clean install, during the installation, you can decide not to use all the available space on the drive for the
Windows partition. Here are reasons not to use all the available space:
● You plan to install more than one OS on the hard drive, creating a dual-boot system. For example, you
might want to install Windows 10 on one partition and leave room for another partition where you intend to
install Windows 11, so you can test software under both operating systems. (When setting up a dual boot,
always install the older OS first.)
● Some people prefer to use more than one partition or volume to organize data on their hard drives. For
example, you might want to install Windows and all your applications on one partition and your data on
another. Having your data on a separate partition makes backing up easier. In another situation, you might
want to set up a volume on the drive that is used exclusively to hold data backups on another computer on
the network. When deciding on the size of the partition that will hold Windows, don’t forget to allow plenty
of room to install its applications as well as at least 15% of free space, which Windows needs to work.
Caution
It’s convenient to back up one volume to another volume on a different hard drive. However, don’t back up one volume
to another volume on the same hard drive; if the drive fails, all volumes on the drive might be damaged, and you could
lose both your data and your backup.

In the module “Maintaining Windows,” you learn to use the Disk Management utility after Windows is installed
to create partitions from unallocated space and to resize, delete, and split existing partitions.
Verify That You Have the Windows Product Key
Core 2 Objective 1.9
Typically, you’ll purchase Windows 10/11 online, with the product key emailed to the Microsoft account used to
make the purchase. If you purchased Windows 10/11 on a USB flash drive or DVD, look for the product key printed
on the cover of the case, on a card inside the case, or affixed to the back of the Windows documentation booklet.
However, keep in mind that the product key might not be required to reinstall Windows. After Windows is
activated the first time with a valid product key, Windows assigns a digital license to the machine and stores it along
with information about the computer’s physical hardware (called the hardware signature) on Microsoft activation
servers. If Windows is installed later, it can retrieve this information from Microsoft servers rather than requesting
that you reenter the product key.
In addition, for a laptop, all-in-one, or other brand-name computer, the computer manufacturer might have stored
the Windows product key on motherboard firmware. When reinstalling Windows, setup can retrieve this product
key from the firmware. Either way, the new Windows installation is assigned a digital license, and you don’t have to
enter the product key during the installation.
To determine if Windows 10 was activated using a product key or digital license, open the Settings app, click Update &
Security, and click Activation (see Figure 12-7). For Windows 11, open the Settings app, click System, and click Activation.

Using the Media Creation Tool to Create a Bootable Windows 10 Setup
DVD or Flash Drive
Est. Time: 15 minutes excluding download time
Core 2 Objective: 1.9
When you download the Windows 10 setup files from Microsoft, you start by downloading the Media Creation Tool.
After you install and launch the tool, you use it to download Windows setup files; you also have the option to create
a bootable DVD or USB flash drive. You learn how to use the Media Creation Tool later in this module.
Applying Concepts
The Media Creation Tool and Windows setup files can be downloaded for free from Microsoft. Therefore, when
you purchase Windows 10, you are really only purchasing a product key, which is required to activate a license
to use Windows 10. The product key is emailed to your Microsoft account email address.
Note 9
To create the installation media, you’ll need a blank DVD or an 8 GB or larger USB flash drive. You’ll also need at
least 8 GB of free space on your hard drive. Use a blank flash drive because any data on it will be lost. To use the Media
Creation Tool to download Windows setup files and create a bootable DVD or USB flash drive, follow these steps:
1. To download and install the Media Creation Tool, use a working computer, go to the website microsoft.com/
en-us/software-download/windows10, and click Download tool now. Execute the file that downloaded.
2. Accept the license terms. In the next window, shown in Figure 12-8, select Create installation media
(USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC, and click Next.
Figure 12-8 The Media Creation Tool can be used to upgrade
a computer or to create installation media
3. Select a language and architecture (64-bit, 32-bit, or both), as shown in Figure 12-9. (Windows 10 is the
only edition available to select.) Alternatively, if you’re creating installation media as a troubleshooting
tool for the computer you’re using, check Use the recommended options for this PC. Click Next.

4. On the next screen, select USB flash drive or ISO file, which you can later burn to a DVD. If you choose
USB flash drive, the tool searches for the drive. If you choose ISO file, the tool asks for the location to save
the file (see Figure 12-10). Navigate to the location, click Save, and follow the on-screen instructions.
After the download completes, if you chose to save an ISO file, you will be given the opportunity to insert
a DVD in the disk drive, right-click the ISO file, and click Burn disc image.
The best practice is to save the Windows setup files to a USB flash drive or ISO image. You never know when
you’ll need the files later to repair a corrupted Windows installation.

Here’s some useful information about an ISO file:
● An ISO file, also called an ISO image or disc image, is an image of an optical disc, including its file system
and all its files and folders. An ISO (International Organization for Standardization) file has an .iso file
extension.
● To see the contents of an ISO file, open Explorer, right-click the file, and click Mount. The ISO file is assigned
a drive letter, and you can drill down into its contents.
● If you have an optical drive that can write to DVDs and you want to burn a DVD from an ISO file, insert a blank
DVD in your optical drive, and double-click the ISO file. Follow the on-screen directions; Windows does the rest.
● You can mount an ISO file to a virtual DVD drive in a virtual machine and use it to install Windows in the
VM, as you would with a physical DVD installed in a physical computer.
Prepare for a Windows 11 Upgrade or New Installation
Core 2 Objectives 1.1, 1.3
When Windows 10 checks for updates and finds Windows 11 available and the system qualifies for Windows 11, the
Windows Update window in the Settings app gives you the opportunity to download and install Windows 11. See
Figure 12-11. Follow instructions on screen to perform the update.
Figure 12-11 Windows 10 update offers a free upgrade to Windows 11
For a Windows system that does not automatically report the option to install Windows 11, you can follow these
steps to find out if the system qualifies for Windows 11:
1. To verify that Secure Boot is enabled, enter msinfo32.exe in the search box to open the System
Information window. Look for Secure Boot State, which appears as On or Off. Refer back to Figure 12-1.
2. To determine if the TPM chip is a high enough version and is enabled, enter tpm.msc in the search
box. The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) window appears and reports the status of the TPM.
See Figure 12-12. Notice TPM is enabled, but the version is version 1.2, which does not qualify for
Windows 11. This Windows 10 computer is more than ten years old.)

have three options:
● To upgrade the current Windows 10 system to Windows 11, download and run the Windows 11
Installation Assistant, which steps you through the process of verifying the hardware qualifies for
Windows 11 and upgrading to Windows 11.
● To perform an upgrade or clean install on another computer, click Create Windows 11
Installation Media and follow the directions to create a bootable USB drive or DVD. (The USB
drive or blank dual-layer DVD must be at least 8 GB.) You can also use this option to download an
ISO file.
● To download an ISO file that contains multiple editions of Windows 11, click Download Windows 11

You can upgrade from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro by using the Settings app within Windows. If you have
already purchased a Windows 10 Pro product key, simply change the product key on the Activation page in the Settings
app, and then follow the on-screen instructions. Alternately, you can go to the Microsoft Store app, purchase Windows 10
Pro, then follow the on-screen instructions. An upgrade from one edition of Windows 10 to another via the Settings app
or the Microsoft Store is easy and does not require going through the entire upgrade process.
Note 11
Installing Windows 10 or Windows 11
Core 2 Objective 1.9
In this part of the module, you learn the steps to install Windows as an in-place upgrade and clean install. You also
learn how to handle problems with installations. As you install and configure software, be sure to document what
you do. This documentation will be helpful for future maintenance and troubleshooting. In a project at the end of
this module, you will develop a documentation template.
Let’s begin with how to perform an in-place upgrade of Windows 10.
Windows 10 In-Place Upgrade
Core 2 Objective 1.9
Here are the steps to perform an in-place upgrade from Windows 10/8.1/7 to Windows 10 when you’re working with
a Windows 10 setup DVD or USB flash drive:
1. Sign in to Windows using an administrator account, which is a user account that has the right to install
system software.
2. As with any upgrade installation, do the following before you start the upgrade:
● Scan the system for malware using an updated version of anti-malware software. When you’re done,
be sure to close the anti-malware application so it’s not running in the background.
● Uninstall any applications or device drivers you don’t intend to use in the new installation.
● Make sure your backups of important data are up to date, and then close any backup software running
in the background.
3. Insert the Windows 10 setup DVD or flash drive or mount the setup ISO file. Recall that to mount an ISO
file, you right-click it and click Mount. Windows assigns a drive letter to the file, and you can access its
contents.
4. Open File Explorer and double-click the setup.exe program in the root of the device or mounted ISO
file. (For a DVD, the setup program might start automatically.) When the User Account Control dialog
box appears, click Yes. The setup program loads files, examines the system, and reports any problems it
finds. If it finds the system meets requirements, the Install Windows 10 window appears, telling you it will
download current updates next. See Figure 12-15. To allow updates to download (recommended), click
Next. If you don’t want to download updates (such as when you have an unstable Internet connection),
click Change how Windows Setup downloads updates, and then click Not right now.

(see Figure 12-16). You have two options:
● Enter the product key; Windows verifies that the key is valid. If the computer is connected to the
Internet, setup will automatically activate Windows during the installation. Click Next.
● If you think Windows should activate without the product key, click I don’t have a product key. On
the next screen, select the Windows product you are installing, and click Next.

Windows might not require a product key because it expects you will associate a Microsoft account with the installation.
Setup lets you know you must activate Windows later by using the Settings app.
In addition, as of this writing, Microsoft is still offering a free upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 or
Windows 7 with Service Pack 2 applied. When Windows 8.1/7 is healthy and activated, no product key is requested
when you upgrade to Windows 10, which then activates with no problem.

Windows 10 Clean Install
Core 2 Objective 1.9
Recall that a clean install is the best option to use if the current installation is sluggish or causing problems, the
currently installed OS does not allow for an in-place upgrade, or you’re installing Windows 10 on a new hard drive
or new desktop computer you’re building.
If you have a Windows 8.1/7 installation that qualifies for a Windows 10 upgrade and you need to do a clean
install, follow these steps:
1. Begin by starting the installation from the Windows desktop as you would for an upgrade.
2. Follow the previous steps for an in-place upgrade. When you get to the Ready to install window (refer
back to Figure 12-17), click Change what to keep.
3. On the Choose what to keep window (refer back to Figure 12-18), click Nothing and click Next. Then
continue with the installation. The contents of the volume holding the previous version of Windows are
deleted. If the hard drive has other volumes, they are left unchanged.
Use the following steps to perform a clean install on a newly installed hard drive, on a new computer you’re
building, or on a computer that has a corrupted Windows installation that refuses to start:
1. Boot from the Windows setup DVD or USB flash drive. Recall that you first might need to change the
boot priority order in BIOS/UEFI. In the Windows Setup screen (see Figure 12-19), select the language and
regional preferences, and click Next. On the next screen, click Install now.

Clean Install in a Dual-Boot Configuration
If you want to install two OSs on the same computer in a dual-boot configuration, you might need to shrink a partition
to make room for a second partition to hold the next OS. For Windows, use Disk Management to shrink a partition,
create a new partition, or format a partition. How to use Disk Management is covered in the module “Maintaining
Windows.” After you have created a second partition to hold the second OS, start the installation. When you get to
the Where do you want to install Windows? screen (see Figure 12-23), select the partition or unallocated space for
the new OS, and continue with the clean install.

Installations in a Virtual Machine
Core 2 Objective 1.9
Another type of Windows installation is when you install Windows in a virtual computer. A virtual computer or virtual
machine (VM) is software that simulates the hardware of a physical computer. Using this software, you can install and
run multiple operating systems at the same time on a single computer, which is called the host machine. These multiple instances of operating systems can be used to train users, run legacy software, and support multiple operating
systems. For example, help desk technicians can run a virtual machine for each OS they support on a single computer
and quickly switch from one OS to another by clicking a window. Another reason to use a virtual machine is that you can
capture screenshots of the boot process in a virtual machine, which is how some screenshots were made for this text.
Software used to create and manage VMs is called a hypervisor. Some popular hypervisors for Windows are
Client Hyper-V by Microsoft (microsoft.com), VirtualBox by Oracle (virtualbox.org), and VMware Workstation Player
by VMware, Inc. (vmware.com). Be aware that hypervisor software and VMs require a lot of memory and might slow
down your system. Figure 12-25 shows two virtual machines running under VirtualBox.
Figure 12-24 Use the boot loader menu in a
dual-boot environment
When using a dual boot, you can execute an application while one OS is loaded even if the application is
installed under the other OS, as long as each OS is using
the same architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). If the application
is not listed on the Windows 10 Start menu or the Windows 8.1 Start screen, locate the program file in Explorer.
Double-click the application to run it.
Upgrade or Clean Install for
Windows 11
Core 2 Objectives 1.1, 1.9
If you created a bootable Windows 11 USB flash drive or
DVD or downloaded an ISO file, begin the Windows 11
upgrade or clean install using the media or ISO file. Upgrading to Windows 11 or performing a clean install works the
same as it does for Windows 10.

Setting Up a VM
Est. Time: 45 minutes excluding download time
Core 2 Objective: 1.9
Here are the steps to set up a VM using Windows 10 Pro:
1. Go into BIOS/UEFI setup on your computer, and make sure virtualization is enabled.
2. Hyper-V is disabled in Windows 10 Pro by default. To turn it on, open the Settings app, select the Apps
group, select Apps and features, and click Programs and Features. In the Programs and Features
window, click Turn Windows features on or off. Place a check mark by Hyper-V and click OK. You’ll need
to restart the system for the change to take effect.
3. To launch the Hyper-V Manager, open the search box, type Hyper-V, and then click Hyper-V Manager.
The Hyper-V Manager window appears on the desktop. In the Hyper-V Manager pane on the left, select
the host computer (see Figure 12-26).
Applying Concepts

Install Windows in a Client Hyper-V VM
Client Hyper-V is the virtual machine (VM) manager that is part of 64-bit Windows 10/11 Pro. If your processor and
motherboard support hardware-assisted virtualization (HAV), you can use Client Hyper-V to install and manage virtual
machines on the desktop. Generation 1 VMs allow either a 32-bit or 64-bit installation of an OS in a VM. Generation 2
VMs require a 64-bit guest operating system. Hyper-V can connect a VM to the local network. Client Hyper-V supports
dynamically expanding virtual hard drives and dynamically allocated memory. When using dynamically expanding
virtual hard drives, the VM ties up only the portion of the host’s hard drive that the VM’s hard drive is actually using.
When using dynamic memory, the VM ties up only the portion of allocated memory that it is actually using.

Solve Problems With Installations
Core 2 Objective 1.9
In this part of the module, we look at a few special situations you might encounter when installing Windows and
what to do about them, including how to install Windows on a new hard drive when you don’t know its product key,
and problems that require preparing a hard drive before the installation.
Verifying Windows Is Activated
When you enter a product key while installing Windows, Windows should already be activated. To view the activation status in Windows 10, open the Settings app (click Start and click the Settings cog icon), select the Update &
Security group, and then select Activation. See Figure 12-35. For Windows 11, in the Settings app, click System and
click Activation. If the system is not activated, click Change product key and enter the key.
Figure 12-35 View the activation status using the Settings app
Dealing With Old and Unknown Product Keys
Suppose a hard drive that has Windows installed fails and you must install Windows 10/11 on the replacement hard
drive, or you want to move your Windows installation from one computer to another. You need to be aware of how
you deal with the product key associated with your license of Windows. Three ways you can purchase or acquire
Windows are the following:
● An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) license of Windows, which is less expensive than a retail
license, can be purchased from third-party vendors such as Amazon (amazon.com) or Newegg (newegg.com).

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Here is what to do when you install an older license of Windows 10/11 on a new hard drive:
● Microsoft retains information about the system on which Windows is installed. When you perform a clean
install on a new hard drive in this system, Microsoft recognizes the system. During setup, click I don’t have
a product key, and Windows should activate with no problem.
● If you move a Windows retail license to a new computer, enter the product key that you purchased from the
Microsoft online store. If you don’t know the product key, sign in at microsoft.com, and check your order
history.
● You cannot move a Windows 10/11 OEM license from one computer to another. To have a legal installation
of Windows, you need to purchase a new OEM license.
● If you have a Windows 10/11 free upgrade license from a previous retail license of Windows 8.1/7, you can
move it to a new computer. To do so, during the new installation, click I don’t have a product key. After the
installation, in the Settings app, go to the screen to change the product key, and then enter your product
key for Windows 8.1/7.
If you don’t know the email address that was used to purchase a retail license, you can find the product
key by opening an Administrator Command Prompt window and entering the command:
wmic path softwarelicensingservice get oa3xoriginalproductkey
The product key displays. If you are using a digital license, nothing displays. How to use a command prompt window
is covered in the module “Maintaining Windows.”
Note 16
Suppose Windows 10 Pro is activated on a system and then gets corrupted. You perform a clean install to fix the
problem, but setup automatically installs and activates Windows 10 Home without asking for a product key. You can
fix the problem by going to the Activation window and changing the product key to the default product key for Pro:
VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T. The system should reactivate with Windows 10 Pro.
Note 17
The OEM license is associated with the motherboard on which it is first installed and, therefore, cannot be
transferred to a new motherboard. It can, however, work with a new hard drive.
● A retail license for Windows can be purchased at the Microsoft online store (microsoftstore.com). The
product key is sent to the Microsoft email address used to make the purchase. The retail license follows
the Microsoft email account from one PC to another.
● Microsoft still offers a free upgrade to Windows 10/11 from Windows 8.1 or 7. The free upgrade does not
have a Windows product key associated with it; instead, it is assigned a digital license.

Converting an MBR Drive to GPT
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.9
Suppose you want to use a 64-bit version of Windows and UEFI firmware mode for added security, thus requiring
you to use the GPT partitioning system. However, your hard drive has already been partitioned with the MBR system.
The error won’t show up until you get to the step in the installation where you select the partition or unallocated
space on the hard drive to hold the Windows installation (see Figure 12-36).
Applying Concepts
Figure 12-36 An error appears when Windows requires the GPT
partitioning system

the wireless network. You might need to enter a password to the Wi-Fi network.
2. To verify access to the local network, open Explorer and verify that you can see other computers on the
network (see Figure 12-39). Try to drill down to see shared resources on these computers.
3. To verify Internet access, open the browser and try to navigate to a couple of websites.

If a problem arises, the problem might be that you need to install the drivers for the motherboard, including the
drivers for the onboard network port. Also, the DNS, IP address, subnet mask, and gateway settings might be wrong.
The A+ Core 1 exam covers the Internet Protocol (IP) addressing scheme and how TCP/IP settings are configured. You
can review this content in the modules “Networking Fundamentals” and “Network Infrastructure and Cloud Computing.”
Core to Core
Do the following to verify TCP/IP settings:
1. In Control Panel, open the Network and Sharing Center and click Change adapter settings. The Network
Connections window opens. Right-click the connection and select Properties. See Figure 12-40.
Figure 12-40 Verify TCP/IP settings for the current network connection
2. Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and click Properties. Verify the TCP/IP configuration as
you learned to do in the module “Networking Fundamentals.” The steps are briefly summarized here:
● An IP address is assigned to a network connection when the connection is first made, and it can be
a 32-bit string written as four decimal numbers called octets, such as 192.168.100.4. IP addresses are
used to locate devices on a network or the Internet.
● A subnet mask, which is four decimal numbers separated by periods (for example, 255.255.255.0),
tells Windows whether a remote computer is on the same or a different network.
● A gateway is a device through which network traffic flows from one network to another. The default
gateway is the gateway used unless another gateway is specified.
● DNS (Domain Name System or Domain Name Services) servers receive an address such as
www.cengage.com and return the IP address of that computer on the Internet so the client computer
can use the IP address to locate the www.cengage.com computer.

● An IP address can be assigned as a dynamic IP address by a server each time the workstation connects
to the network or as a static IP address, which is permanently assigned to the computer. If the network
is using static IP addressing, verify the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway are correct.
● When dynamic IP addressing is used, DNS server addresses are also most likely received
automatically. However, if DNS server addresses are given, verify these DNS servers are working. A
simple way to do that is to use the ping and nslookup commands. You learn to use both commands in
the module “Network Security and Troubleshooting.”
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to know how to configure a wired or wireless network connection to include DNS settings, subnet mask, gateway address, and static or dynamic IP addressing.

Install Windows Updates
Core 2 Objective 1.5
To protect the system from malware, be sure to install Windows updates before you attempt to install applications or
hardware. By default, Windows updates automatically on a regular basis. To apply any pending Windows 10 updates,
open the Settings app, and click the Update & Security group. (For Windows 11, in the Settings app, click Windows
Update.) In the Windows Update window (see Figure 12-41), you can view the update status and install any available
updates. Depending on the situation, you might click Restart now to finish installing updates, click Download and
install or click Install now to install available updates, or click Check for updates if no updates are available. Keep
installing important updates and checking for more updates until no more are available. You might need to restart
the system after certain updates are installed.

You can uninstall an update and/or manage update settings. Here’s what you can do from the Settings app:
● View or uninstall an update. In the Settings app, click Update & Security, and then click Windows Update
in the left pane. Click View update history to review recent updates and to uninstall updates that are available for uninstallation (see Figure 12-42). (For Windows 11, on the Windows Update window, click Update
history.)
If you see available updates that refuse to install on an older system, you can perform an in-place upgrade of Windows
10. The upgrade process should apply all available updates.
Note 18
Figure 12-42 Use the Settings app to manage Windows 10 updates
● Schedule restarts and active hours. In the Windows Update window, use the Update settings section to
schedule a pending restart or to set active hours, during which time the computer will avoid automatic
restarts. Note that if a scheduled restart occurs outside of active hours but when the computer is in use,
you will have an opportunity to delay the restart.
● Update other Microsoft products and Windows features. In the Windows Update window, click Advanced
options. In the Advanced options window (see Figure 12-43), you can choose to receive updates to other
Microsoft products along with Windows updates. You can also allow Windows to automatically sign you in
and finish installing updates after a Windows restart.
● Defer or pause updates. For Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows, you can open the Advanced options
window to choose when updates will be installed or to pause updates. Notice in Figure 12-43 that updates
can be deferred for up to 35 days. You cannot defer or pause security updates in this window.

Install Hardware
Core 2 Objective 1.3
You’re now ready to install the hardware devices that were not automatically installed during the Windows installation. Be sure to install 32-bit drivers for a 32-bit OS and 64-bit drivers for a 64-bit OS. Also, as much as possible,
install drivers designed for Windows 10/11, although drivers written for Windows 8.1/7 might work. As you install
each device, reboot and verify that the software or device is working before you move on to the next item. Most
likely, you will need to do the following:
● Install the drivers for the motherboard. Motherboard drivers might come on a CD or DVD bundled with
the motherboard, or you can download them from the motherboard manufacturer’s website. To start the
installation, double-click a setup program on the disc or one that you downloaded, and follow the on-screen
directions.
● Even though Windows has embedded video drivers, install the drivers that came with the video card so
you can use all the features the card offers. These drivers are on disc or are downloaded from the video
card manufacturer’s website.
● Install printers. To install a local USB printer, all you have to do is plug it in, and Windows will install it
automatically. For a network printer, you can run the setup program that came with the printer, and the
program will find and install the printer. Alternately, open Control Panel in Classic view (how to is coming up) and open the Devices and Printers window. Then click Add a printer and follow the on-screen
directions.
● For other hardware devices, always read and follow the manufacturer’s directions for the installation.
Sometimes you are directed to install the drivers before you connect the device, and sometimes you will
first need to connect the device.
If a problem arises, turn to Device Manager, which you find in Control Panel.
Using Control Panel
Control Panel is a window containing several small utility programs called applets that are used to manage hardware, software, users, and the system. (In general, a utility program is used to maintain a system or fix a computer
problem.) To access Control Panel in Windows 10/11, type Control Panel in the search box on the taskbar.
By default, Control Panel appears in Category view, with utilities grouped by category. To switch to Classic
view, click Category and select either Large icons or Small icons. Figure 12-45 shows the Windows 10 Control Panel
in Small icons view. Windows 11 Control Panel looks and works the same way. Use the search box in the title bar to
help find information and utilities in Control Panel.

Using Device Manager
Device Manager in Control Panel is your primary Windows tool for managing hardware. (Its program file is named
devmgmt.msc.) It lists all installed hardware devices and the drivers they use. Using Device Manager, you can disable or enable a device, update its drivers, uninstall a device, and undo a driver update (called a driver rollback).
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to be able to use Control Panel utilities in a given scenario. Utilities covered in this
module include Devices and Printers, Programs and Features, Network and Sharing Center, System, User Accounts,
Device Manager, and Ease of Access. Other utilities are covered in later modules.
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to know which scenarios are appropriate for using Device Manager. You also need to
know how to use the utility and how to evaluate its results.
Figure 12-46 Use Device Manager to uninstall, disable, or enable a device
To access Device Manager, use one of these methods:
● Open Control Panel in Classic view, and click Device Manager.
● Right-click Start and select Device Manager.
● Enter the devmgmt.msc command in the Windows search box.
A Device Manager window is shown in Figure 12-46.
Click an arrow to expand the view of an item or to collapse the view. Here are ways to use Device Manager to
solve problems with a device:
● Uninstall and reinstall the device. To uninstall the device, right-click it and click Uninstall device on the
shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 12-46. (Alternately, you can click Properties in the shortcut menu to open
the Properties dialog box and then click Uninstall Device on the Driver tab, as shown in Figure 12-47A.) Then

reboot the system. Windows will recognize that the device is not installed and attempt to install the appropriate driver. Look for issues during the installation that point to the source of the problem. Sometimes,
though, reinstalling a device is all you need to do. Notice in Figure 12-47B that the selected Device type is
Cameras and that the camera is connected through a USB interface. Sometimes USB devices are listed in
Device Manager, and sometimes they are not.

● Look for error messages offered by Device Manager. To get more information about a device, look for error
messages that show up on the General tab of the Properties dialog box (see Figure 12-47B). Some messages
might suggest a solution.
● Update or roll back the drivers. Click the Driver tab (see Figure 12-47A) to update the drivers and roll back
(undo) a driver update.
Updating Device Drivers
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.3
Follow these steps to use Device Manager to update device drivers:
1. For best results, locate and download the latest driver files from the manufacturer’s website to your hard
drive. Be sure to use 64-bit drivers for a 64-bit OS and 32-bit drivers for a 32-bit OS. If possible, use drivers
specifically designed for Windows 10 or Windows 11.
2. Using Device Manager, right-click the device and select Properties from the shortcut menu. The
Properties dialog box for that device appears. Select the Driver tab, and click Update Driver. The Update
Driver Software dialog box opens.
3. To search the Internet for drivers, click Search automatically for updated driver software. If you have
already downloaded drivers to your computer, click Browse my computer for driver software, and
point to the downloaded files. Note that Windows is looking for an .inf file to identify the drivers. Continue
to follow the on-screen directions to complete the installation.

Manage User Accounts in Windows
Core 2 Objective 2.5
You might want to associate your local account with your Microsoft account so you can get easy access to Microsoft
resources in the cloud, such as OneDrive. Keep these points in mind:
● Administrator access to your online accounts. Anyone with administrator rights on the computer has
access to all the user data on the computer. When using a Microsoft account to sign in, an administrator also
has access to your Microsoft private settings, apps, and online accounts. Therefore, you would only want to
set up your Microsoft account on a computer in a situation in which you trust people with administrative
access to the computer.
● Switch to a Microsoft account. To connect an existing local account or network ID to a Microsoft account,
open the Settings app, click Accounts, and then click Sign in with a Microsoft account instead. See
Figure 12-48. Follow the on-screen directions, which include entering your current Windows password.
Figure 12-48 Associate a local account with a Microsoft account

● Switch back to a local account. If you want to switch the user account back to the local account, go back
to your account settings, click Your info, and click Sign in with a local account instead.
Creating a Local Account
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.5
To create a new account, you can use the Windows 10/11 Settings app or the Computer Management console. In
addition, you can manage user account by opening the User Accounts applet in Control Panel. You have more control over creating and setting up an account when you use the Computer Management console, as you learn in the
module “Securing and Sharing Windows Resources.” For now, let’s use the Settings app to create a local account:
1. Sign in to Windows with an administrator account.
2. Open the Settings app. Click Accounts. Click Family & other users, and, for Windows 10, click Add
someone else to this PC (for Windows 11, click Add account). See Figure 12-49. Click I don’t have this
person’s sign-in information, and click Add a user without a Microsoft account (see the right side of
Figure 12-49). Enter a user name, enter the password twice, and click Next.
Applying Concepts
Figure 12-49 Bypass the Microsoft account and create a local account
3. The account created is a standard account. To change the account type to administrator, click the
account and click Change account type. Then select Administrator and click OK. To remove the
account, select it and click Remove.
The first time a user signs in to Windows with the account, user files and folders (called the user profile) are
created in the C:\Users folder.
If users want to use the ease of access features of Windows, show them how to go to Control Panel and open
the Ease of Access Center the first time they sign in. When a setting is selected here (for example, the magnifier,
narrator, or high contrast), it is automatically launched each time the user signs in.

After moving user data from one computer to another, the best practice is to leave the user data on the original computer untouched for at least two months. This practice gives the user plenty of time to make sure everything has been
moved over.

After you have created user accounts in a new installation of Windows, you might want to copy user data files
from the C:\Users folder or other folders on the hard drive of the old computer to the new computer. How to copy
files and folders on a network is covered in the module “Maintaining Windows.”
User Account Control Dialog Box
At some point while you are working with a computer to maintain or troubleshoot it, the User Account Control (UAC)
dialog box will pop up (see Figure 12-50). If the UAC dialog box appears and you are signed in as an administrator,
all you have to do is click Yes to close the dialog box and move on, as shown in Figure 12-50A. If the user account
does not have administrative privileges, you’ll have to enter the password of an administrative account to continue,
as shown in Figure 12-50B.
The purposes of the UAC dialog box are (1) to prevent malicious background tasks from gaining administrative
privileges when the administrator is signed in and (2) to make it easier for an administrator to sign in using a less
powerful user account for normal desktop activities but still be able to perform administrative tasks while signed
in as a regular user. The UAC dialog box stands as a gatekeeper to malware installing behind your back, because
someone has to click the UAC dialog box before the installation can proceed.
You can control how the UAC dialog box works. In Control Panel, click User Accounts and click Change User
Account Control settings. The User Account Control Settings window appears (see Figure 12-51). In the figure, the
recommended setting is selected.

Install Applications
Core 2 Objective 1.7
A user account with administrator privileges has permission to install software for all users; this software is normally
installed in the C:\Program Files folder for 64-bit software or the C:\Program Files (x86) folder for 32-bit software.
Both folders require administrator permissions to edit the folder’s contents. For these installations, expect a UAC
dialog box to appear to verify the installation (refer back to Figure 12-50A). Here are two exceptions:
● A user with standard privileges can install software that is designed to install in their C:\Users profile folder
if it does not make changes to protected areas of the Windows registry. (The registry is a database of Windows settings.) The software can only be used by this one user account.
● If a user signed in with a standard account attempts to install software, such as anti-malware software, that
is designed to run under all user accounts, a UAC dialog box appears (see Figure 12-50B). To continue with
the installation, the user must enter the password for an administrator user account.
Before Installing an Application
Before installing an application, consider the following:
● Compatibility with the OS. If at all possible, install applications designed for Windows 10 or Windows 11.
For best performance, install 64-bit apps in a 64-bit OS. It’s possible to install 32-bit apps in a 64-bit OS, but
you cannot install 64-bit apps in a 32-bit OS.
● Hardware requirements. How much RAM will the app use when running? Does the CPU meet the minimum
required? Is there enough free space on the hard drive for the app and its data? Does the app require significant Video RAM (VRAM)? Some graphics-intensive apps, such as video games, recommend a dedicated
graphics card with embedded VRAM rather than the standard video components embedded on the motherboard (called integrated video).
● Specialized hardware. Some apps that require high security use a hardware token to help authenticate a
user to the app. An external hardware token might require an input device such as a USB port required by the
token shown in Figure 12-52. The token must be configured in the app according to IT department instructions.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Impact to network performance. Before installing software, research how much network activity the software produces. You might want to set its priority as high or low on the network to control its performance
or to keep it from hogging network resources. Prioritizing applications on a network, which is called Quality
of Service (QoS), is done by using Device Manager to configure the network adapter on each computer on
the network, configuring the router that gives access to the network, and, for a Windows domain, changing
QoS settings in Group Policy.
● Impact to device. For an application that uses the Internet, consider if it will make the computer vulnerable to attack. Read manufacturer documentation and reviews about how to secure the application and
the system, such as making changes to Windows Firewall or installing each app in its own secured virtual
machine on the host computer.
● Impact to operations. Read online reviews about the software, and, if possible, talk with other IT professionals who have supported the software. Has it been reported that the software has security issues, bogs
down the network, or is generally difficult to support? Are users satisfied with the software? Is it difficult
to train users on the software? Consider how existing data will import into the software. Examine online
documentation for the software. How difficult is it to install the software and import existing data into it?
Are security patches and updates easy to attain and implement? In general, does it do what it claims to do
with relatively little IT support?
● Impact to business. A business application—such as asset management, accounting, or payroll—should
relieve the work of humans to make it possible for humans to focus on the core business of an organization. An application can do just the opposite if it does not work as expected, has bugs, is difficult to use, or
constantly needs maintenance. Can you count on IT support from the software developer in the event of a
software failure or errors? If the software is mission critical to the success of your organization, it’s especially
important to do your research about how much support you’ll get when problems arise.
Installing and Uninstalling Apps
Applications can be installed from physical media (DVD, CD, or USB flash drive), from a downloaded application
file, directly from the web, from the Windows Store, from an ISO file downloaded and mounted in Windows, or from
a folder shared by another computer on the network.
To install applications from an ISO file, disc, USB flash drive, or software downloaded from the Internet, open
Explorer, locate and double-click the setup program file, and follow the on-screen directions to launch the installation routine. After an application is installed, you might also need to install any updates available for the application
on the manufacturer’s website.

Special Concerns When Working
in a Large Enterprise
Core 2 Objective 1.9
Working as an IT support technician in a large corporate environment is different from working as an IT support
technician for a small company or with individuals. In this section of the module, you learn how Windows is installed
on computers in an enterprise.
Earlier in the module, you learned how to install Windows using a setup DVD, USB flash drive, or files downloaded from the Microsoft website, and you had to respond to each question asked during setup. These types of
installations are called attended installations.

If, however, you were responsible for installing Windows on several hundred computers in a large corporation,
you might need a less time-consuming method. These methods are called deployment strategies. As an IT support
technician in a large corporation, you most likely would not be involved in choosing or setting up the deployment
strategy. However, you need to be aware of the different strategies so you have a general idea of what will be expected
when you are asked to provide desk-side or help desk support as Windows is being deployed in your organization
or a desktop OS that has failed needs to be refreshed.
Beginning with Windows 10, Microsoft expanded the methods it offers to deploy Windows in an enterprise.
These methods are listed in Table 12-5. Some methods were designed to work with on-premises domains controlled
by Active Directory (AD), and others work with Azure Active Directory (AAD) in the cloud.
Category Method Description
Modern deployments: Use these methods with AD or AAD domains.
Windows Autopilot Streamlines the OOBE (out-of-box experience) for devices
preregistered with the enterprise. When users receive a new
device, turn it on, connect to the Internet, and enter their user
account and password, the device is automatically joined to
AAD and configured with settings and content specific for the
organization without further user input.
In-place upgrade Automates an in-place upgrade from Windows 10/8/7 to
Windows 10/11 using a setup created by a system administrator
with tools in the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT).
Dynamic deployments: Use these methods with AAD domains.
Subscription activation Used to upgrade Windows Pro to Windows Enterprise.
When a user signs in to AAD, the Windows upgrade happens
automatically without user input or a restart. Product keys and
Windows licensing information are kept in AAD, not on the
local computer. This method creates a Windows subscription.
Azure Active Directory
join with MDM
MDM (mobile device management) is software that forces
devices to comply with corporate policies when they join an
AAD domain.
Provisioning packages When a device joins AAD and MDM is not implemented,
a provisioning package containing settings, apps, and data
specific for the enterprise is downloaded to the device and
applied with minimal input from the user. This package is
easier to set up than an image, which is used in traditional
deployments.
Traditional image deployments: Use these methods for on-premises AD domains when older deployment
strategies are already established in the enterprise.
Bare metal Also called wipe-and-load deployment, a standard image is
created that contains the OS, drivers, applications, settings, and
data specific for the enterprise. The image can be deployed on
a new, empty hard drive, or the drive can first be wiped clean.
Refresh Also called wipe-and-load deployment, user settings and
data are saved, and the hard drive is wiped clean before the
standard image is applied. Then the image is applied, and the
user state is reinstalled.
Replace Used to replace an old device with a new one. After the
standard image is applied to the new computer, the user state
is copied from the old computer and applied to the new one.

Methods to Deploy a Standard Image
Core 2 Objective 1.9
A standard image contains the entire Windows volume in a single Windows Imaging (WIM) file, which has a .wim
file extension. Installing Windows on a computer via a standard image is called a deployment image. Here are a few
details about image deployments:
● A standard image is hardware independent, meaning it can be installed on any computer. (In the module
“Maintaining Windows,” you learn to create other types of images that can only be used on the computer
that created them.)
● A standard image is created in a process called drive imaging. Microsoft provides several tools you can use
to image a drive; many are included in the MDT.
● Deploying a standard image always results in a clean install rather than an upgrade.
Image deployment can be started using one of these methods:
● Local installation. Your company might provide you with a bootable flash drive or DVD that contains the
image. When you boot from the device, Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) is launched;
this is a minimum operating system used to start the installation. Follow the on-screen instructions.
● Network installation. To boot to the network and deploy the image from a server, first go to BIOS/UEFI setup
and configure it to boot from a network device. You might need to search the motherboard documentation
for help; in general, you’ll need to change the following or similar settings, which are likely to be on an
Advanced screen or Boot screen:
■ Enable the Network Stack (see Figure 12-54). For the LAN controller, enable the PXE option. The
Preboot eXecution Environment or Pre-Execution Environment (PXE) is programming contained in
BIOS/UEFI that can start up the computer and search for a server on the network that can provide a
bootable operating system (Windows PE on the deployment server).

IT support technicians find that large enterprises appreciate quick and easy solutions to desktop or laptop computer
problems. Technicians quickly learn that their marching orders are almost always “replace or reimage.” Little time is
spent trying to solve the underlying problem when hardware can quickly be replaced or a Windows installation can
quickly be reimaged.
Note 23
■ Disable Secure boot, Fast boot, and Quiet mode.
■ Enable CSM support. In the CSM group, enable Boot from network devices.
■ Change the boot priority so that an IPv4 Network boot is listed first. If you don’t see it as an option, reboot
after making the changes in the previous three bullets. The Network boot option should then be available.
■ Select the Network boot option to have the computer launch PXE. The identification for the Network
boot option might include IPv4 and the name of the network adapter, as shown in Figure 12-55.
When you restart the computer, PXE searches for a server on the network, and Windows PE on the
deployment server is launched.
● Push automation. A technician does not start the image deployment; rather, the installation uses push
automation when a user is not likely to be sitting at the computer. The entire remote network installation
is automated, and no user intervention is required. The process can turn on a computer that is turned off
and even works when no OS is installed on the computer or the current OS is corrupted.
Depending on how the system administrator has set up the deployment, you might be required to respond to
questions as the installation progresses. An unattended installation does not require any responses, such as the
administrator password or domain name, because these responses are stored in an answer file. After the installation completes, the User State Migration Tool might be used to transfer user settings, user data files, and application
settings to the new installation.
The degree of work required by a technician to deploy an image is called high-touch, lite-touch, or zero-touch.
The less involved the technician or user is, the more work is required by the system administrator to set up the
deployment. For this reason, lite-touch or zero-touch deployments are only used in very large organizations.

Use USMT Software
Core 2 Objective 1.9
The User State Migration Tool (USMT) can be used when deploying Windows in a Windows domain to copy user
files and settings from one computer to another. Let’s look briefly at what to expect when using the following three
commands, which are part of the USMT software:
● scanstate copies user settings and files from the source computer to a safe location.
● loadstate applies these settings and files to the destination computer.
● usmtutils provides encryption options and hard drive management.
The scanstate, loadstate, and usmtutils command lines can be lengthy and include references to .xml files along
with other parameters. The details of these command lines are not covered in this text. Most likely, the commands
are stored in script file, sometimes called a batch file, provided by the system administrator. You learn to use scripts
in the module “Linux and Scripting.”
Module Summary
Evaluating a System for Windows 10 or Windows 11
● Windows 10 editions include Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Pro for Workstations, and
Windows 10 Enterprise. Each successive edition in the list costs more and offers more features than the
previous one.
● Windows 11 editions include Windows 11 Home, Windows 11 Pro, Windows 11 Pro for Workstations, and
Windows 11 Enterprise.
● Each edition of Windows 10/11 is available in either a 32- or a 64-bit version. A 32-bit OS cannot address
as much memory as a 64-bit OS. A 64-bit OS performs better and requires more memory than a 32-bit OS.
● Before purchasing Windows, make sure your system meets the minimum hardware requirements and that
all the hardware and applications will work under the OS. A 64-bit OS requires 64-bit drivers.
● Use the System Information (msinfo32.exe) window to gather information about Windows and the computer.
Understanding How Windows Supports Networking
● Windows computers can be configured on a network as a workgroup, which is a peer-to-peer (P2P) topology,
or in a Windows domain, which is a client/server configuration created by Active Directory.
● Azure Active Directory (AAD) manages a virtual network of Windows computers in the cloud.
● A Windows account can be a local account, a network ID (to connect to a Windows domain), or a Microsoft
account (to access Microsoft online resources and/or join an Azure AD domain).
● A Windows account can be a standard account or an administrator account with more privileges in the system.
Final Checklist Before Beginning the Installation
● Before you begin installing Windows, verify you have backed up all user data and preferences and that you
have the Windows product key.
● Use the Media Creation Tool to create bootable media with the setup files for Windows 10/11.
Installing Windows 10 or Windows 11
● Windows can be installed as an in-place upgrade or a clean installation.
● Windows can be installed from the setup DVD, a USB flash drive, or from an ISO file, all created via the Media
Creation Tool.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● An in-place upgrade begins from the Windows desktop of the old Windows installation.
● A clean install is the best option to use if the current installation is sluggish or giving problems, or if you’re
installing Windows on a new desktop computer that you’re building.
● Windows 10/11 Pro and Enterprise include Client Hyper-V, which is a hypervisor used to create and manage
virtual machines.
What to Do After a Windows Installation
● After a Windows installation, verify network access, install any Windows updates, verify anti-malware
settings, install hardware, create user accounts, and install applications.
Special Concerns When Working in a Large Enterprise
● Three types of deployments for installing Windows in a large enterprise are modern deployments,
dynamic deployments, and traditional image deployments. Modern deployments are done using Active
Directory (AD) or Azure Active Directory (AAD), dynamic deployments use AAD, and traditional deployments use AD.
● Zero-touch deployments require the most time to set up but do not require a technician to be at the computer
when the installation happens.

Introduction
Earlier in the text, you learned how to install Windows. This module takes you to the next step in learning how to
support a Windows operating system: maintaining the OS after it is installed. Most Windows problems stem from
poor maintenance. If you are an IT support technician responsible for the ongoing support of several computers,
you can make your work easier and your users happier by setting up and executing a good maintenance plan for
each computer you support. A well-maintained computer gives fewer problems and performs better than one that
is not maintained. In this module, you learn how to schedule regular maintenance tasks, prepare for disaster by
setting up backup routines for user data and system files, and use Windows tools and commands to manage files,
folders, and hard drives. As you read, you might consider practicing the steps in the module on a Windows 10/11
computer or VM.
Critical Windows Settings
and Backup Procedures
Core 2 Objectives 1.4, 4.3
Regular preventive maintenance includes verifying critical Windows settings and backing up data and system files.
If you notice the system is slow as you perform these routine chores, you need to dig deeper to improve Windows
performance, which is covered in the module “Troubleshooting Windows After Startup.”
Users sometimes change Windows settings without realizing their importance. If you find settings that are incorrect, take time to explain to the computer’s primary user how important they are.
When you’re responsible for a computer, be sure to keep good records of all that you do to maintain, upgrade, or fix
it. When performing preventive maintenance, take notes and include them in your documentation. The Computer
Inventory and Maintenance document available at cengage.com can help you organize your notes.
Note 1
Here are the critical Windows settings you need to verify and what you can do to keep the system performing
well. The first four settings are the most important:
●● Windows updates. Install any important Windows updates that are waiting to be installed, and verify that
Windows Update is configured to automatically allow updating. These updates may include updates to
Windows, applications, device drivers, and firmware. You learned how to configure Windows Update in the
module “Installing Windows.”
●● Antivirus/anti-malware software. Verify that anti-malware software is configured to scan the system regularly and that it is up to date. If you discover it is not scanning regularly, take the time to do a thorough scan
for viruses. To verify this, follow the directions in the module “Installing Windows.”
●● Network security setting. Use the Network and Sharing Center to check that the network security type is
set correctly for the optimum firewall settings. The network types are public and private. How to verify
the network type was covered in the module “Installing Windows.” The module “Network Security and
Troubleshooting” goes deeper into configuring network security.
●● Backups of user data, the Windows volume, and system files. Following directions given later in this
module, verify that backup routines are running as expected to protect data and software from loss or
corruption.
●● Uninstall software you no longer need. This helps overall performance by reducing the number of startup
processes running in the background and freeing up hard drive space. To uninstall software, use the Windows
Apps & Features window or the Programs and Features window.

●● Clean up the hard drive. A hard drive needs at least 15 percent free space on drive C:, where Windows is
installed. Later in the module, you learn how to use Disk Cleanup to erase unnecessary files on drive C:.
You can also move data on the drive to the cloud, other media, or other volumes on the same hard drive.
●● For laptops, verify power options. Set power options to conserve power and increase the time before a
battery pack needs recharging.
Don’t forget that what you learn about maintaining Windows also applies to Windows in a VM. All the skills you learn
in this module apply to physical computers and VMs.
Note 2
Before we get into maintenance chores, let take a quick look at some useful Windows settings.
Useful Settings and Control Panel Applets
Core 2 Objectives 1.4, 1.5
Here is a handy list of settings in the Settings app you can use to access numerous Windows 10/11 settings and a
couple of applets in Control Panel. The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know how to use all these in a given scenario:
●● Accounts. Find your Windows account information here or link your account to a Microsoft account. The
Accounts group also includes email and app accounts, sign-in options, Microsoft account sync settings,
options to sign in to work or school networks, and options to add new user accounts to the computer.
●● Apps. Use this group to uninstall applications, set default applications, and check other application settings.
For example, to make Outlook the default app for email, click Apps, click Default apps, and then change the
setting from Mail to Outlook.
●● Devices (Bluetooth & devices in Windows 11). Find settings here for printers and scanners, connected
devices, Bluetooth, mouse and touch pad devices, typing, AutoPlay, and USB.
●● Gaming. This group contains settings for the Xbox Game bar, Game DVR, broadcasting, and Game Mode.
When you turn on Game Mode, Windows improves the gaming experience by prioritizing system resources
for the game being played on the computer.
●● Network & Internet. This group provides network status, data usage information, and settings for different
connections, including Wi-Fi, Ethernet, dial-up, VPN, and mobile hotspots. Go here to set up new connections. Airplane mode and proxy settings are also available for mobile devices. The link to the Network and
Sharing Center takes you to more advanced connection settings.
●● Personalization. Find settings here for the background, colors, lock screen, themes, Start menu, and taskbar.
●● Privacy (Privacy & security in Windows 11). Find the settings here to restrict or allow Windows or apps
access to your information and resources, including your location, camera, microphone, notifications,
speech, inking, typing, account information, contacts, calendar, call history, email, messaging, radios, and
file system. The Privacy group is also where you adjust settings for feedback, diagnostic, and usage data
that is sent to Microsoft. You can also choose which apps are allowed to run in the background.
●● System. Look here for catchall information and settings that affect functions of your computer, such as those
for adjusting display, notifications, power, sleep, storage, and tablet-mode settings. Important information
about the Windows system can be seen on the About window in the System group. See Figure 13-1.
The About window in the System group gives information similar to what you find in the System Information window,
including processor, RAM, Windows edition, architecture, and version. You can also get to several troubleshooting tools
from this window. The About window can also be accessed by clicking System in Control Panel.

●● Time & Language. The Time & Language group provides settings for date and time, region and language,
and speech.
●● Update & Security. Tools and settings found here include Windows updates, backups, recovery, activation, links to Find My Device, and settings for power users, such as device discovery, Remote Desktop, and
PowerShell.
Figure 13-1 Use the About window to find out important information
about hardware and the Windows installation
Some items in the Settings app may be unavailable if you are logged in with a standard account. Use an account with
administrative privileges to view all available settings.
Note 4
Here are two applets in Control Panel that users find handy:
●● The Sound applet is used to select a default speaker and microphone and to adjust how Windows handles
sounds. To control volume, you can use the volume icon in the taskbar.
●● Use the Mail applet in Control Panel to set up Outlook email. You can also configure Outlook from within
the Outlook app.
Now let’s turn our attention to maintenance chores. We begin with power options for laptops.
Power Options
Core 2 Objective 1.4
One maintenance chore for laptops is to verify that power options are set to conserve power and increase the
amount of time before a battery pack on a laptop needs recharging. Power is managed by putting the computer into
varying degrees of suspend or sleep modes. Use the Power Options applet of Control Panel to change these settings.

Here are the different power-saving states:
●● Sleep mode. Using Windows, you can put the computer into
sleep mode, also called standby mode or suspend mode, to
save power when you’re not using the computer. If applications
are open or other work is in progress, Windows first saves the
current state, including open files, to memory and saves some of
the work to the hard drive. Then everything is shut down except
memory and enough of the system to respond to a wake-up.
In sleep mode, the power light on the laptop might blink from
time to time. (A laptop generally uses about 1% to 2% of battery
power for each hour in sleep mode.) To wake up the computer,
press the power button; for some computers, you press a key or
touch the touch pad. Windows wakes up in about two seconds.
When Windows is in sleep mode, it can still perform Windows
updates and scheduled tasks. Windows can be configured to go
to sleep after a period of inactivity, or you can manually put it
to sleep. To put the system to sleep manually, click Start, then
click the power icon and select Sleep. See Figure 13-2. A laptop
might also be configured to go to sleep when you close the lid.
●● Hibernation. Hibernation saves all work to the hard drive and
powers down the system. When you press the power button,
Windows reloads its state, including all open applications and
documents. When Windows is in sleep mode on a laptop and
senses the battery is critically low, it will put the system into
hibernation.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam might give you a scenario and expect you to know which power options to change to solve a
problem, including using power plans and sleep (suspend), hibernate, and standby modes.
Configuring Windows Power Plans
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.4
Follow these steps to configure power plans in Windows 10:
1. Open Control Panel in Classic view, and click Power Options. The Power Options window opens.
Figure 13-3 shows the window for one laptop. The plans might be different for other laptops.
Applying Concepts
(continues)
Recall that hard drives are permanent or nonvolatile storage, and memory is temporary or volatile storage. A hard
drive does not require power to hold its contents. Memory, on the other hand, is volatile and loses its contents when
it has no power. In hibernation, the computer has no power; therefore, everything must be stored on the hard drive.

4. To see several other changes you can make, click Change advanced power settings. The Power Options
dialog box opens. Check out the USB selective suspend setting shown on the right side of Figure 13-4.
By default, Windows puts USB ports in a very low power state when they are not in use. If USB ports are
not behaving reliably, one thing you can try is to disable selective suspend, as shown in the figure. Make
your changes and click OK to close the box.
5. If you made changes, click Save changes in the Edit Plan Settings window. Close the Power Options window.

2. Use links in the left pane to choose what happens when you click a power button and close the lid. When
you click Choose what closing the lid does, you can turn on fast startup to improve performance.
3. You can create and customize a power plan. For example, under Balanced (recommended), click Change
plan settings. The Edit Plan Settings window appears (see the left side of Figure 13-4). Notice in the figure the
various times of inactivity required before the computer goes into sleep mode; these are called sleep timers.

The time to prepare for disaster is before it
occurs. If you have not prepared, the damage from
a disaster will most likely be greater than if you had
made and followed disaster recovery plans. Suppose
the hard drive on your computer or a particular USB
flash drive stopped working and you lost all its data.
What would be the impact? Are you prepared for this to happen? The following sections discuss some of the
decisions you need to make for your backup and recovery plans.
Where to Keep Data and Backups
An overview of six options as to where to keep data and backups is shown in Figure 13-5. Here are the options if you
keep your data on your local computer, as shown on the left side of Figure 13-5:
●● Option A: Use no backup. When you have no backups and your hard drive fails, you have no other choice
than to reenter your data.
●● Option B: Create and maintain your own backups. Windows File History and Windows Backup and Restore
are two Windows utilities designed to work in this type of scenario. An advantage of this option is that you
have complete control over the data and the backups. The primary disadvantage is you’re responsible for
all backup and recovery operations. If you use this option, consider what would happen if a catastrophic
event, such as a fire or flood, destroys the building where your original data and backups are all located.
For this reason, always keep some backups at an off-site location.
●● Option C: Back up to the cloud. Cloud services such as Carbonite (carbonite.com) and iDrive (idrive.com)
are designed for this solution. They automatically copy your data to the cloud when you’re connected to
the Internet and in real time.
Plan for Disaster Recovery
Core 2 Objective 4.3
In this part of the module, you learn how to make a disaster recovery plan and then learn how to use Windows to
back up user data, entire volumes, and critical Windows system files.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know how to use Power Options in Control Panel to create a power plan, including
choosing what to do when closing the lid, turning on fast startup, and disabling USB selective suspend.
With data and software, here’s a good rule of thumb:
If you can’t get along without it, back it up.
Note 6
Backups Pay Off
Est. Time: 5 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 4.3
Dave was well on his way to building a successful career as an IT support technician. His IT tech support shop was
doing well, and he was excited about his future. But one bad decision changed everything. He was called to repair a
server at a small accounting firm. The call was on the weekend when he was normally off, so he was in a hurry to get
the job done. He arrived at the accounting firm and saw that the problem was an easy one to fix, so he decided not
to do a backup before working on the system. During his repairs, the hard drive crashed, and all data on the drive
was lost—four million dollars’ worth! The firm sued, Dave’s business license was stripped, and he was ordered to pay
the money the company lost. A little extra time to back up the system would have saved his whole future. True story!

If you don’t want to keep data on your local computer, you have these options, shown on the right side of
Figure 13-5.
●● Option D: Keep your data in the public cloud. Examples of cloud services designed to hold your original
data and work with your applications are Microsoft OneDrive (onedrive.live.com), which works well with
Microsoft Office, and Google Drive (drive.google.com), which integrates well with Google Docs. Using this
method, you are trusting the cloud service with the only copy of your data unless you download files.
●● Option E: Data is kept on a local file server and backed up to private media. Keeping data on a file server
rather than the local computer gives more control of the data to the network administrator and makes it
easier to share the data among users. The disadvantage of this method is that the user must be on the local
network to access the data, which makes it more complicated to access data when traveling or working
from home. With this option, the organization is responsible for maintaining backups.
●● Option F: Data is kept on a local file server and backed up to the cloud. The main advantage of keeping
the backups of an organization’s data in a public cloud is the cloud service is responsible for all backup
routines and supporting recovery operations when your data is lost.

Even though it’s easy to do, don’t make the mistake of backing up your data to another volume or folder on the same
hard drive. When a hard drive crashes, all volumes most likely will go down together, and you will lose your data and
your backup. Back up to another device, and for extra safety, store it at an off-site location.
Note 7
This author keeps two backups of data, both in the cloud. I use Carbonite for real-time backups to the cloud, and I back
up data on my computer to Dropbox daily.
Note 8
Many organizations trust all their data to a public cloud so the organization is not responsible for maintaining
backup software and routines and testing the backups. However, experienced IT technicians agree that you should
maintain two backups, one of which is kept off site. These operations standards follow the 3-2-1 backup rule:
●● Three copies of your data (the original data and two backups)
●● Two media (for example, an external hard drive and in the cloud)
●● One copy off site (for example, in the cloud)
Many organizations maintain one or more backup routines, and you need to understand how backups and data
recovery work and what you are expected to do when maintaining backups for your organization.

Backup Types
Generally, you should back up data for about every 4 to 6 hours of data entry. When you think about it, that’s a lot of
storage and procedures used for backups. To make backing up the most efficient, three types of backups are used:
●● A full backup backs up all data designated for backup.
●● An incremental backup backs up only files that have changed or been created since the last backup,
whether that backup is itself an incremental or a full backup.
●● A differential backup backs up files that have changed or been created since the last full backup. A differential backup does not consider if other differential backups have been performed.
A backup routine always begins with a full backup and then uses either an incremental or differential backup
several times, with an additional full backup made occasionally. When a file, folder, or volume is recovered, the recovery process must reconstruct the lost or corrupted items from the latest full backup and then apply any changes
reflected in all the incremental backups since the last full backup—or in the latest differential backup—to create the
synthetic (reconstructed) file, folder, or volume.
Rotating Backup Media
Backup routines might use the grandfather-father-son (GFS) plan for rotating and reusing backup media. The plan
is explained in Table 13-1. A backup operator would be responsible for putting the plan in writing and keeping a log
of backups performed.
Name of
Backup
How Often
Performed
Storage
Location Description
Son backup Daily On site Make six backups each week, rotated (reused) each week.
A Friday backup is not made. Label the media Saturday, Sunday,
Monday, and so forth. When you rotate the backup media each
week, the backup for a given day is overwritten each week.
Father
backup
Weekly Off site On Friday, perform a weekly full backup, and rotate or reuse the
media each month. Label the media Friday1, Friday2, Friday3,
and Friday4. Store the media off site.
Grandfather
backup
Monthly Off site, in
a fireproof
vault
Perform the monthly full backup on the last Friday of the month.
Keep 12 media, one for each month, and label them January,
February, March, and so forth. Store the media in a vault off site.
Table 13-1 The grandfather-father-son backup rotation plan
The plan shown in the table allows you to rotate media daily, weekly, and monthly. However, if an organization
is required to retain data for a longer period, rotations happen less often.
Testing Your Backup Plan
After you have a backup plan working, test the recovery plan. Operations standards should state the frequency that the
backup plan is tested to make sure all is still working as you expect and you know how to recover data. Do the following:
●● Test the recovery process. Erase a file on the hard drive, and use the recovery procedures to verify that
you can recreate the file from the backup. This test verifies that the backup media works, that the recovery
software is effective, and that you know how to use it. After you are convinced that the recovery procedure
works, document how to perform it. Write the documentation so others can follow it in the event you are
not present when it’s needed.
●● Keep backups in a safe place and routinely test them. Don’t leave a backup DVD, external hard drive, flash
drive, or other media lying around for someone to steal. Backups of important and sensitive data should be
kept under lock and key at an off-site location. Keep enough backups off-site so that you can recover data
even if the entire building is destroyed.
Now let’s see how to use Windows tools to back up user data, the entire Windows volume, and important
Windows system files. How to back up in macOS and Linux is covered in later modules.

Back Up User Data and the System Image
Core 2 Objective 4.3
Windows 10 offers File History and Backup and Restore to back up user data and create a system image. A system
image is a backup of the entire Windows volume, including the Windows installation, applications, user settings,
and data. The best time to create the image is right after you’ve installed Windows, hardware, applications, and user
accounts and customized Windows settings. The image is stored in a single file with a .wim file extension. The WIM
file uses the Windows Imaging File (WIM) format and is a compressed file that contains many related files.
Windows uses only one backup tool at a time, either File History or Backup and Restore. One must be turned off to
use the other. In addition, both tools allow only one backup routine. Therefore, if you want to use two backup routines
(such as when you want to keep one backup on a local device and a second backup in the cloud), you must use thirdparty backup software that allows for multiple backup routines.
Note 9
Figure 13-6 Select what to back up to OneDrive
Windows File History
Windows File History is a simple backup utility that is easy for users but gives you limited control over backups.
When the backup is enabled, it first makes a full backup to another medium. By default, it scans for file and folder
changes every hour and keeps as many generations of backups as free space allows on the storage device.
To use File History, first connect your backup device. In the Settings app, click Update & Security, then click
Backup. See the left side of Figure 13-6. You have two options for the backup location:
●● To back up to OneDrive in the Microsoft cloud, click Sign in to OneDrive and follow directions to back up
the Desktop, Documents, and/or Pictures to OneDrive. See the right side of Figure 13-6. Later, if you want to
see or recover a file from your backups, open your OneDrive folder in Explorer.
●● To back up to a local peripheral device or drive on the network, click Add a drive and select the location.
By default, File History backs up all data folders in your user profile. To view and change what is backed up,
click More options in the Backup window.

Windows Backup and Restore
Windows 10 offers Backup and Restore to back up any folder on the hard drive and create a system image. While
File History is designed to be an easy tool for users to manage their own backups, Backup and Restore is designed
for technicians who prefer more granular control of backups.
When you first turn on Backup and Restore, it does a full backup, followed by incremental backups and occasional full backups. If you’ve established a backup schedule in File History on a Windows 10 machine, those settings
will appear in the Backup and Restore window.
Follow these steps to save a full backup and set up an ongoing backup schedule using Backup and Restore in
Windows 10:
1. Open Control Panel in Classic view, and click Backup and Restore. If no backup has ever been
scheduled on the system, the window will look like the one shown in Figure 13-8. Click Set up backup.
2. Select the device or location to
hold the backup. All Windows
10 professional and enterprise
editions allow you to save
the backup to a network
location. To do so, click Save
on a network, click Browse,
and point to the folder. See
Figure 13-9. Also enter the
user name and password on
the remote computer that
the backup utility will use to
authenticate to that computer
when it makes the backup.
You cannot save to a network
location when using Windows
Home editions.
Figure 13-7 Manage File History settings, create a system image, and restore

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam might give you a scenario that
expects you to create, use, and test backups.
File History can also be accessed through Control
Panel, where you can turn File History on or off, change
File History settings, and restore files from backup.
Using the File History window in Control Panel, you
can click System Image Backup (see Figure 13-7) to
start the process of creating a system image.

3. In the next box, you can allow Windows to decide what to back up or choose for yourself. Select Let me
choose so you can select the folders to back up. Click Next.
4. In the next box, make your selections. If the backup medium can hold the system image, the option to
include the image is selected by default. If you don’t want to include the image, uncheck the option. Click
Next to continue. Here are folders that might contain important user data:
●● Application data is usually found in C:\Users\username\AppData.
●● Better still, back up the entire user profile at C:\Users\username.
●● Even better, back up all user profiles at C:\Users.
5. In the next box, you can verify that the correct items are selected. To change the default schedule, click
Change schedule. In the next box, you can choose to run the backup daily, weekly, or monthly and
select the time of day. Make your selections and click OK.
6. Review your backup settings, and click
Save settings and run backup. The backup
proceeds. A shadow copy is made of any
open files so they are included in the backup.
Later, you can return to the Backup and Restore
window to change the backup settings or to turn off
the backup.
One limitation of Windows File History and Backup and
Restore is that you can have only one scheduled backup
routine.

After Windows does a full backup, it only backs up files that have changed since the last full backup. Occasionally, it
does another full backup. Each full backup is called a backup period. Windows keeps as many backup periods as it has
space on the backup device. As free space fills, it deletes the oldest backup periods. To see how space is used on your
backup media, click Manage space in the Backup and Restore window. In the Manage Windows Backup disk space, you
can click View backups to delete a backup period, but be sure to keep the most recent backup periods.
Note 11
Restoring Files and Folders
To restore backed-up items in File History, open File History in Control Panel, and click Restore personal files. To
restore items in Backup and Restore, open the Backup and Restore window, and click Restore my files. Another
way to restore a file or folder from backup is to use Explorer. Follow these steps:
1. When you restore a file or folder to a previous version, the current file or folder can be overwritten by
the previous version. To keep the original, first copy—not move—the folder or file to a new location so
you can revert to the copy if necessary.
2. Right-click the file or folder, and select Restore previous versions from the shortcut menu. The
Properties dialog box for the file or folder appears with the Previous Versions tab selected. Windows
displays a list of all previous versions of the file or folder it has kept (see Figure 13-10); these versions
were created by File History or Backup and Restore.
Figure 13-10 Restore a file or folder from a previous version
3. Select the version you want, and click Restore. A message box asks if you are sure you want to continue.
Click Restore and then click OK.

4. Open the restored file or folder, and verify that it is the version you want. If you decide you need another
version, delete the file or folder, and copy the file or folder you saved in Step 1 back into the original
location. Then return to Step 2 and try again, this time selecting a different previous version.
Tips About the System Image
As you’ve already learned, the backup of a Windows volume is called a system image. Here are points to keep in
mind when creating a system image and using it to recover a failed Windows volume:
●● Creating a system image takes some time. Before creating a system image on a laptop, plug the laptop into
an AC outlet so that a failed battery will not interrupt the process.
●● A system image includes the entire drive C: or other drive on which Windows is installed. When you
restore a hard drive using the system image, everything on the volume is deleted and replaced with the
system image.
●● Don’t depend just on the system image as your backup. You should back up individual folders that contain
user data separately from the system image. If only individual data files or folders need to be recovered,
you would not want to use the system image for the recovery because it would totally replace the entire
Windows volume.
●● You can create a system image any time after Windows is installed, and then you can use this image to
recover from a failed hard drive. Using the system image to recover a failed hard drive is called reimaging the drive. The details of how to reimage a drive are covered in the module “Troubleshooting Windows
Startup.”
The system image you create can be installed only on the computer that was used to create it. A hardware-independent
image is called a standard image or deployment image, as you learned in the module “Installing Windows.”
Note 12
Back Up Windows System Files With System Protection
Core 2 Objective 1.4
Before Windows gives trouble, you can prepare for an easy fix by backing up critical Windows system files. When
the System Protection utility is turned on, it automatically backs up system files and stores them on the hard
drive weekly and just before major Windows updates and user applications are installed. These snapshots of the
system are called restore points and include Windows system files that have changed since the last restore point
was made. A restore point does not contain all user data, and you can manually create a restore point at any time.
System Restore (rstrui.exe) restores the system to its condition at the time a restore point was made. If you restore
the system to a previous restore point, user data on the hard drive will not be altered, but you can affect installed
software and hardware, user settings and passwords, and OS configuration settings. You’ll learn more about System
Restore in the module “Troubleshooting Windows After Startup.”
Enabling System Protection
System Protection is turned off by default in Windows 10. To enable System Protection, open Control Panel, open
the System window in Settings, and click About. In the left panel of the About window, click System protection.
(Alternately, you can click Recovery in Control Panel and then click Configure System Restore.) The System
Protection tab of the System Properties dialog box appears (see the left side of Figure 13-11). Make sure protection is turned on for the drive containing Windows, which indicates that restore points are created automatically.
In Figure 13-11, protection for drive C: is on, and other drives are not being protected. To make a change, click
Configure. The System Protection dialog box appears, as shown on the right side of the figure. If you make a change
to this box, click Apply and then click OK.

Restore points are normally kept in a hidden folder named C:\System Volume Information, which is not accessible to the user. Restore points are taken at least weekly, and they can use up to 10 GB or 5% of disk space. If overall
disk space gets very low, restore points are no longer made, which is one more good reason to keep at least 15%
or more of the hard drive free. Also notice in Figure 13-11 that you can limit how much of the disk can be used for
restore points, and you can click Delete to delete all restore points.
Manually Creating a Restore Point
Before you make major changes to the system, you can manually create a restore point so you can back out of your
changes if necessary. To create a restore point, use the System Protection tab of the System Properties box, as shown
on the left side of Figure 13-11. Click Create. In the System Protection box, enter a name for the restore point, such
as “Before I tested APP3 software,” and click Create. The restore point is created.
Maintaining Hard Drives
Core 2 Objectives 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
For best performance, Windows needs at least 15% free space on the hard drive that it uses as working space, so
it’s important to uninstall software you no longer need and occasionally delete unneeded files. In addition, you can
optimize a hard drive and control indexing to improve performance. You also need to know how to set up a new
hard drive installed in a system. All these tasks are covered in this section of the module. Let’s start with changing
settings in File Explorer Options.

File Explorer Options
Core 2 Objective 1.4
The Windows File Explorer Options applet in Control Panel is used to control how users view files and folders in
Explorer and what they can do with these files. Windows has an annoying habit of hiding file extensions if it knows
which application is associated with a file extension. For example, just after installation, it hides .exe, .com, .sys,
and .txt file extensions, but does not hide .docx, .pptx, or .xlsx file extensions until the software to open these files
has been installed. Also, Windows really doesn’t want you to see its own system files, and it hides these files from
view until you force it to show them.
A compressed folder can save space on the hard drive and is often used to make files smaller so they can more easily
be sent by email. A compressed (zipped) folder has a .zip extension. Any file or folder that you put in this folder will
be compressed to a smaller size than normal. When you remove a file or folder from a compressed folder, the file or
folder is uncompressed back to its original size. In general, Windows treats a compressed folder more like a file than a
folder. To create a compressed folder, right-click in white space in the Explorer window, select New from the shortcut
menu, and click Compressed (zipped) Folder.
Note 14
The Windows desktop is itself a folder on the hard drive and is located at C:\Users\username\Desktop. For example,
if the user, Anne, creates a folder named MyFiles on her desktop, the folder path is C:\Users\Anne\Desktop\MyFiles.

Optimize the Hard Drive
Core 2 Objective 1.3
Two types of hard drives are magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs), which contain spinning platters, and solid-state
drives (SSDs), which contain flash memory. Windows uses the Defragment and Optimize Drives (dfrgui.exe) utility to automatically defragment a magnetic drive and to trim an SSD once a week. Let’s look at what each of these
operations accomplishes:
●● Magnetic hard drives. To defragment
(or defrag) is to rearrange fragments or
parts of files on the drive so each file is
stored on the drive in contiguous clusters. Each platter on a magnetic hard
drive is divided into tracks, which are
divided into sectors (see Figure 13-15).
In a file system, a cluster, also called a
file allocation unit, is a group of whole
sectors. The number of sectors in a
cluster is fixed and is determined when
the file system is first installed. A file is
stored in whole clusters, and the unused
space at the end of the last cluster,
called slack, is wasted free space. As files are written and deleted from an HDD, clusters are used, released,
and used again. New files written on the drive can be put in available clusters spread over the drive. Over
time, drive performance is affected when the moving read/write arm of a magnetic drive must move over
many areas of the drive to collect all the fragments of a file. Defragmenting a drive rewrites files in contiguous clusters and improves drive performance.
●● Solid-state drives. The life span of an SSD is largely determined by the number of read/writes to the drive.
Therefore, defragmenting an SSD can reduce the life of the drive and is not recommended—Windows
disables defragmenting for solid-state drives. However, performance of an SSD can benefit from trimming.
To trim an SSD is to erase a block on the drive that is filled with unused data. An SSD is organized in blocks,
and each block contains many pages. A file can spread over several pages in various blocks. Each time a
new page is written to the drive, the entire block to which it belongs must be read into a buffer, erased, and
then rewritten with the new page included. When a file is deleted, information about the file is deleted, but
the actual data in the file is not erased. This can slow down SSD performance and reduce the life of the drive
because the unused data must still be read and rewritten in its block. Windows sends the trim command
to an SSD drive to erase a block that no longer contains useful data so a write operation does not have to
manage the data.
Follow these steps to optimize the hard drive:
1. Using Explorer, open the Properties dialog box for Drive C:, and select the Tools tab. Click Optimize. The
Optimize Drives dialog box appears (see the left side of Figure 13-16). This system has two hard drives
installed. Drive C: is an SSD, and drive E: is a magnetic HDD. Drive D: is a removable USB flash drive.
2. Here are tasks you can do:
●● For a magnetic drive, click Analyze for Windows to tell you if a drive needs defragmenting. To defrag
the drive, click Optimize. The process can take a few minutes to several hours. If errors occur
while the drive is defragmenting, check the hard drive for errors and try to defragment again.
●● For a solid-state drive, click Optimize to trim the SSD.
●● Near the bottom of Figure 13-16, you can see scheduled optimization is turned off. To turn it on, click
Turn on. In the dialog box that appears (see the right side of Figure 13-16), check Run on a schedule
(recommended), and select Weekly for the Frequency. Click OK.

Indexing Options
Core 2 Objective 1.4
File Explorer and the Windows taskbar offer a search box that can be used to search the hard drive. The Indexing
Options applet in Control Panel is used to control how Windows manages an index of content on the drive to help
make searches go faster. See Figure 13-17.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Do the following to explore how indexing can be managed:
1. Open Control Panel in Classic view and then open
the Indexing Options applet. The Indexing Options
dialog box on the left side of Figure 13-17 shows what
is currently indexed.
2. To modify this list, click Modify. In the Indexed
Locations dialog box (see the right side of Figure 13-17),
select what you want to index and click OK.
3. Click Advanced. In the Advanced Options dialog
box (see Figure 13-18), notice you can rebuild the
index. This can fix a problem if searches are giving
errors. Also notice the File Types tab in this box. Use
this tab to select what file types (listed by their file
associations) are indexed.
For best performance, select for indexing only those
items that the user searches often. For example, at the top of
Figure 13-17, you can see more than 48,000 items are being
indexed. By selecting only a few types of files for indexing,
such as OneNote and Outlook files, fewer system resources are
required to maintain the index. If a user does not search often,
turning off indexing can improve system performance. In addition, indexing is constantly writing to the hard drive, and if the
drive is an SSD, the life span of the drive is decreased. Indexing
is turned off by disabling the Windows Search background process, which you learn how to do in the module “Troubleshooting
Windows After Startup.” Searches still work; they are just slower.
Use Disk Management to Manage Hard Drives
Core 2 Objective 1.3
In the module “Installing Windows,” you learned how to install Windows on a new hard drive. This installation process initializes, partitions, and formats the drive. After Windows is installed, you can use Disk Management (diskmgmt.msc) to install and manage drives. In this part
of the module, you learn to use Disk Management to
manage partitions on a drive, prepare a new drive for
first use, mount a drive, use Windows dynamic disks,
and troubleshoot problems with the hard drive.

what file types are indexed
Caution
Before you use Disk Management to make changes to a
drive, be sure to back it up first.

Resize, Create, and Delete Partitions
Suppose you have installed Windows 10 on a hard drive and used all available space on the drive for the one partition. Now you want to split the partition into two partitions so you can use the second one to hold the backups for
another computer on the network. You can use Disk Management to shrink the original partition, which frees up
some space for a new partition for Ubuntu on the network to use for backups. Let’s see how it’s done:
1. Open the Disk Management window (see Figure 13-21).
Figure 13-21 Shrink a volume to make room for a new partition
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know how to use Disk Management to extend, split, and shrink partitions and
configure a new hard drive in a system.
2. To shrink the existing partition, right-click in the partition space and select Shrink Volume from the
shortcut menu (see Figure 13-21). The Shrink dialog box appears and shows the amount of free space on
the partition. Enter the amount in MB to shrink the partition; this amount cannot be more than the available
amount of free space so no data on the partition will be lost. (For best performance, be sure to leave at least
20% free space on the existing partition.) Click Shrink. The disk now shows unallocated space.
3. To create a new partition in the unallocated space, right-click in that space and select New Simple
Volume from the shortcut menu (see Figure 13-22). The New Simple Volume Wizard opens.
4. Follow the on-screen directions to enter the size of the volume in MB, select a drive letter for the
volume, and select a file system. Leave the Allocation unit size at Default. You can also enter a Volume
label and decide to do a quick format. (A quick format does not check the volume for bad sectors.) The
partition is then created and formatted with the file system you chose. When you open Explorer, you
should see the new volume listed.
Notice in Figure 13-21 the options on the shortcut menu for this MBR system, where you can make the partition
the active partition (the one BIOS/UEFI looks to for an OS), change the drive letter for a volume, format the volume
(which erases all data on it), extend the volume (increase its size), and shrink or delete the volume. Any option not
available for the particular volume and situation is grayed out.

Prepare a Drive for First Use
When you install a new, second hard drive in a computer, use Disk Management to prepare the drive for use. This
happens in a two-step process:
1. Initialize the disk. When the disk is initialized, Windows identifies it as a basic disk. A basic disk is a
single hard drive that works independently of other hard drives. When you first open Disk Management
after you have installed a new hard drive, the Initialize Disk dialog box automatically appears (see
Figure 13-23). Select the partitioning system (MBR or GPT) and click OK. Disk Management now reports
the hard drive as a Basic disk.

Note 17
2. Create a volume and format it with a file system. As you learned to do earlier, you can now create a
New Simple Volume in unallocated space on the disk.
How to Mount a Drive
A mounted drive is a volume that can be accessed by way of a folder on another volume so the folder has more
available space. A mounted drive is useful when a folder is on a volume that is too small to hold all the data you
want in the folder. In Figure 13-24, drive C: is 90 GB, and the mounted drive is 20 GB. The mounted drive gives the
C:\Projects folder a capacity of 20 GB, which increases the effective space available for drive C: to 110 GB. Similar
to how the ext4 file system works in Linux, the C:\Projects folder is called the mount point for the mounted drive.
Follow these steps to mount a drive:
1. Make sure the volume (drive C: in our example) that will host the mounted drive uses the NTFS file
system. The folder on this volume, called the mount point, must be empty. You can also create the folder
during the mount process. In this example, we are mounting a drive to the C:\Projects folder.
2. Using Disk Management, right-click in the unallocated space of a disk. Select New Simple Volume from
the shortcut menu. The New Simple Volume Wizard launches. Using the wizard, specify the amount of
unallocated space you want to devote to the volume. Our example uses 20 GB, although the resulting
size of the C:\Projects folder will only show about 19 GB because of overhead.
3. As you follow the wizard, the dialog box shown on the left side of Figure 13-25 appears. Select Mount in
the following empty NTFS folder, and then click Browse. In the Browse for Drive Path dialog box that
appears (see the right side of Figure 13-25), you can drill down to an existing folder or click New Folder
to create a new folder on drive C:.

4. Complete the wizard by selecting a file system for the new volume; you can also name the volume. The
volume is created and formatted.
5. To verify that the drive is mounted, open Explorer and then open the Properties dialog box for the
folder. In our example, the Properties dialog box for the C:\Projects folder is shown in the middle of
Figure 13-26. Notice the Properties dialog box reports the folder type as a Mounted Volume. When you
click Properties in the Properties dialog box, the volume Properties box appears (see the right side of
Figure 13-26). In this box, you can see the size of the mounted volume minus overhead.

You can think of a mount point, such as C:\Projects, as a shortcut to a volume on a second hard drive. If you
look closely at the left window in Figure 13-26, you can see the shortcut icon beside the Projects folder.
Windows Dynamic Disks
A basic disk works independently of other hard drives, but a dynamic disk can work with other hard drives to hold
data. Volumes stored on dynamic disks are called dynamic volumes. Several dynamic disks can work together to
collectively present a single dynamic volume to the system.
When dynamic disks work together, data to configure each hard drive is stored in a disk management database
that resides in the last 1 MB of storage space on each hard drive. Note that Home editions of Windows do not support dynamic disks.
Here are three uses of dynamic disks:
●● Improve reliability. For better reliability, you can configure a hard drive as a dynamic disk and allocate the
space as a simple volume. This is the best reason to use dynamic disks and is a recommended best practice.
Because of the way a dynamic disk works, the simple volume is considered more reliable than when it is
stored on a basic disk. A volume that is stored on only one hard drive is called a simple volume.
●● Extend a volume across multiple drives. You can implement dynamic disks on multiple hard drives to
extend a volume across these drives (called spanning). This volume is called a spanned volume.
●● Improve performance and/or provide fault tolerance. Dynamic disks can be used to piece data across
multiple hard drives to improve performance and/or provide fault tolerance (protecting data against loss).
The technology to configure two or more hard drives to work together as an array of drives is called RAID
(redundant array of inexpensive disks or redundant array of independent disks).
■ Joining hard drives together to improve performance is called striping or RAID 0. The volume is called
a striped volume (see Figure 13-27). RAID 0 can improve performance because the work is shared
between two hard drives. However, RAID 0 does not provide fault tolerance (if one drive fails, the data
is lost).
■ Copying one hard drive to another as a backup is called mirroring or RAID 1. The volume is called a
mirrored volume (see Figure 13-27). RAID 1 improves fault tolerance because if one drive fails, you have
another copy of the data. RAID 1 can reduce performance because the drives operate at the speed of
the slowest drive and all data must be written twice.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to select which RAID
type is appropriate to use in a given scenario.
When RAID is implemented in this way using Disk Management, it is called software RAID. A more reliable way
of configuring RAID is to use BIOS/UEFI setup on a motherboard that supports RAID, which is called hardware RAID.
You can use Disk Management to convert two or
more basic disks to dynamic disks. Then you can use
unallocated space on these disks to create a simple
volume or a Windows array of disks using a spanned,
striped, or mirrored volume. To convert a basic disk
to dynamic, right-click the Disk area and select Convert to Dynamic Disk from the shortcut menu (see
Figure 13-28). Then right-click free space on the disk and select New Simple Volume, New Spanned Volume, New
Striped Volume, or New Mirrored Volume from the shortcut menu. If you were to select spanning or striping in

Figure 13-28, you could make Disk 1 and Disk 2 dynamic disks that hold a single volume. The size of the volume would
be the sum of the space on both hard drives. If you were instead using mirroring in Figure 13-28, you could make
Disk 2 mirror the volume on Disk 1 as a backup copy. The size of the volume would be the amount of space both
hard drives have in common—which means it would be the size of the smaller of the two disks.
Figure 13-28 Convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk
When Windows implements RAID, you cannot install an OS on a spanned or striped volume that uses software RAID.
You can, however, install Windows on a hardware RAID drive.
Also, after you have converted a basic disk to a dynamic disk, you cannot revert it to a basic disk without losing all
data on the drive.
Note 18
Now for some serious cautions about software RAID where you use Windows for spanning, striping, and mirroring: Microsoft warns that when Windows is used for software RAID, the risk of catastrophic failure increases and
can lead to data loss. Microsoft suggests you only use Windows spanning, striping, or mirroring when you have no
other option. In other words, spanning, striping, and mirroring in Windows aren’t very safe. Instead, use a mounted
drive or use hardware RAID to expand the size of a volume or to copy a volume to another drive.
Use Disk Management to Troubleshoot Hard Drive Problems
Notice in Figure 13-28 that the system has four hard drives (Disk 0, Disk 1, Disk 2, and Disk 3), and information about
the disks and volumes is shown in the Disk Management window. When you are having a problem with a hard drive,
it helps to know what the information in the window means. Here are the disk and volume statuses you might see
in this window:
●● Healthy. The healthy volume status shown in Figure 13-28 indicates that the volume is formatted with a file
system and that the file system is working without errors.

●● Unknown. The boot sector most likely is corrupted, which may have been caused by malware.
●● Unreadable. The file system database cannot be read. Try a reboot.
●● Failed. The hard drive is damaged, or the file system is corrupt. Replace the data cable to the drive, and
make sure it’s getting power. Data on a failed volume is likely to be lost.
●● Active. One volume on an MBR system will be marked as Active. This is the volume that startup BIOS/UEFI
looks to for an OS boot manager to load.
●● EFI System Partition. In GPT systems, one volume will be marked as the EFI System Partition. BIOS/UEFI
looks to this volume to find an OS boot manager to load an OS.
●● Unallocated. Space on the disk is marked as unallocated if it has not yet been partitioned.
●● Formatting. This volume status appears while a volume is being formatted.
●● Basic. When a hard drive is first sensed by Windows, it is assigned the Basic disk status. A basic disk can
be partitioned and formatted as a stand-alone hard drive.
●● Dynamic. The following status indicators apply only to dynamic disks:
■ Online. An online disk status indicates the disk has been sensed by Windows and can be accessed by
either reading or writing to the disk.
■ Online (Errors). A region of the disk is giving errors. Try returning the disk to online status. If the
volume status does not return to healthy, back up all data and replace the drive.
■ Offline or Missing. An offline or missing disk status indicates a dynamic disk has become corrupted
or is unavailable. The problem can be caused by a corrupted file system, a loose or bad drive cable, a
failed hard drive, or another hardware problem. If you believe the problem is corrected, right-click the
disk and select Reactivate Disk from the shortcut menu to bring the disk back online.
■ Foreign drive. If you move a hard drive that has been configured as a dynamic disk on one computer to
another computer, it will report the disk as a foreign drive. To fix the problem, you need to import the
foreign drive. Right-click the disk and select Import Foreign Disks from the shortcut menu. You should
then be able to see the volumes on the disk.
■ Data Incomplete. Some but not all of the drives in the volume have been moved. Move and import the
remaining disks.
■ Healthy (At Risk). The disk can be accessed, but I/O errors have occurred. Try returning the disk to
online status. If the volume status does not return to healthy, back up all data and replace the drive.
If you are still having problems with a hard drive, volume, or mounted drive, check Event Viewer for events
about the drive that might have been recorded there. These events might help you understand the nature of the
problem and what to do about it. How to use Event Viewer is covered in the module “Troubleshooting Windows
After Startup.”
Throughout this module, you’ve learned a lot about Windows tools that use a graphical interface. The next part
of this module discusses ways to perform many related tasks from a command-line interface.
Using a Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Core 2 Objective 1.2
IT support technicians find it much faster to manipulate files and folders and perform other tasks by using commands
in a command prompt window than by using Explorer and other graphical tools. In some troubleshooting situations,
you have no other option but to use a command prompt window.
Windows has two levels of command prompt windows: a standard window and an elevated window. In a standard
window, the default directory is the currently signed-in user’s folder and commands have the same permissions
as that user. Commands issued in an elevated command prompt window have administrative privileges, and the
default directory is C:\Windows\System32.
To open a standard command prompt window (see Figure 13-29), enter command or cmd in the Windows
search box.

Many of the commands you learn about in this section can also be used in the Windows Recovery Environment
(Windows RE), which can be loaded from within Windows during troubleshooting. When Windows fails to start, you can
load Windows RE from Windows setup media or a USB or DVD recovery drive. How to use the Recovery Environment
is covered in the module “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”
Note 19
To open an elevated command prompt window, type cmd or command in the Windows search box, right-click
Command Prompt, and click Run as administrator. Then respond to the UAC box. The Administrator: Command
Prompt window is shown in Figure 13-30. Notice the word “Administrator” in the title bar, which indicates the
elevated window, and the default directory, which is the C:\WINDOWS\system32 folder.

Commands to Manage Files and Folders
Core 2 Objective 1.2
If the command you are using applies to files or folders, the path to these files or folders is assumed to be the default
drive and directory. The default drive and directory, also called the current drive and directory, shows in the command prompt. For example, in Figure 13-29, the default drive is C: and the default path is C:\Users\Jean Andrews.
If you use a different path in the command line, the path you use overrides the default path. Also know that Windows
makes no distinction between uppercase and lowercase in command lines (however, Linux does).
Now let’s look at the file-naming conventions you will need to follow when creating files, wildcard characters
you can use in command lines, and several commands useful for managing files and folders.
File-Naming Conventions
When using the command prompt window to create a file, keep in mind that file name and file extension characters
can be the letters a through z, the numbers 0 through 9, and the following characters:
_ ^ $ ~ ! # % & – { } ( ) @ ' `
In a command prompt window, if a path or file name has spaces in it, it is sometimes necessary to enclose the
path or file name in double quotation marks.
Wildcard Characters in Command Lines
As you work at the command prompt, you can use wildcard characters in a file name to apply the command to a
group of files or to abbreviate a file name if you do not know the entire name. The question mark (?) is a wildcard
for one character, and the asterisk (*) is a wildcard for one or more characters. For example, if you want to find all
file names in a directory that start with A and have a three-letter file extension, you would enter the dir a*.???
command.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know how to use the /?, winver, dir, cd, md, rd, copy, xcopy, robocopy, chkdsk,
format, diskpart, and shutdown commands, which are all covered in this module. Other commands also required for
the A1 Core 2 exam are covered in other modules.
Many commands can use parameters in the command line to affect how the command will work. Parameters (also
called options, arguments, or switches) often begin with a slash or a hyphen followed by a single character. In this
module, you learn about the basic parameters used by a command for the most common tasks. For a full listing
of the parameters available for a command, use the help command. Follow this link on the Microsoft website:
docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands to learn more about
commands.
Note 21
Dir [<Filename>] [/P] [/S] [/W] [/A]
Use the dir command to list files and directories. In Microsoft documentation about a command (also called the
command syntax), the brackets [ ] in a command line indicate the parameter is optional. In addition, the parameter
included in < >, such as <filename>, indicates that you can substitute any file name in the command. This file name
can include a path or file extension. Table 13-3 lists some examples of the dir command.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
CD [<Drive>:\[<Path>]] or CD..
The cd (change directory) command changes the current default directory. You enter cd followed by the drive
(a volume letter, such as C:) and the entire path that you want to be current, like so:
C:\> cd C:\game\chess
The command prompt now looks like this:
C:\game\chess>
To move up from a child directory to its parent directory, enter the .. (dot, dot) variation of the command:
C:\game\chess> cd..
The command prompt now looks like this:
C:\game>
Remember that .. (dot, dot) always indicates the parent directory. You can move from a parent directory to one
of its child directories simply by stating the name of the child directory:
C:\game> cd chess
The command prompt now looks like this:
C:\game\chess>
Remember not to put a backslash in front of the child directory name; doing so tells the OS to go to a directory
named chess that is directly under the root directory.
Drive Navigation
Whereas the cd command moves from one directory to another on the same drive, to move from one drive to
another, type the drive letter followed by a colon. For example, to go from the D: drive to the C: drive:
D:\> c:
The command prompt now looks like this:
C:\>
Know that Windows is usually installed on drive C:.
Command Result
dir /p Lists one screen at a time
dir /w Presents information using wide format, where details are omitted, and files and folders
are listed in columns on the screen
dir *.txt Lists all files with a .txt file extension in the default path
dir d:\data\*.txt Lists all files with a .txt file extension in the D:\data\ folder
dir myfile.txt Checks that a single file, such as myfile.txt, is present
dir /s Includes subdirectory entries
dir /a List all files, including hidden files and system files
Table 13-3 Sample dir commands
In the Windows Recovery Environment, the main drive is X:, but this drive is not always the same as the drive holding
the Windows installation.

MD [<Drive>:]<Path>
The md or mkdir command creates a directory. If no drive is given, the directory is created on the current drive,
and if no path is given, the directory is created in the current directory. For example, to create a subdirectory under
the C:\game directory:
C:\game> md checkers
To create a game directory on the D: drive:
C:\game> md d:\game
Del [<Drive>:] [<Path>][<Filename>]
The del command deletes files. You can use the wildcard characters to delete multiple files. For example, to delete
all files with a .txt file extension in the C:\game\chess directory, use this command:
C:\> del \game\chess\*.txt
Attrib [1 OR 2 S] [1 OR 2 H] [<Drive>:]<Path>
The del command does not delete a file that is a system file or a hidden file. To change the system and hidden attributes for a file(s), use the attrib command. For example, to remove the hidden and system attributes assigned to
all files in the C:\game\chess directory, use this command:
C:\> attrib -h -s c:\game\chess\*.*
The del and attrib commands can be used together to delete Windows system files, making these commands
scary powerful. Use them with caution!
RMDIR [<Drive>:]<Path> [/S]
The rmdir or rd command removes or deletes a directory. Before you can use the rmdir command, know the
following:
●● Unless you use the /s switch, the directory must be empty; it cannot contain files or subdirectories.
●● The directory must not be the current directory.
For the C:\game\chess example given earlier, to remove the \game directory, you must first remove the chess
directory:
C:\> rmdir c:\game\chess
C:\> rmdir c:\game
Use the /s switch to remove a directory that is not empty. The directory and all its subdirectories and files will
be removed. With this switch, the rmdir command is very powerful—use it with caution!
Copy [/V] [/Y] <Source> [<Destination>]
The copy command copies a single file or group of files. The original files are not altered. To copy a file from one
drive to another, use a command similar to this one:
E:\> copy C:\Data\Myfile.txt E:\mydata\Newfile.txt
The drive, path, and file name of the source file follow the copy command. The drive, path, and file name of the
destination file follow the source file name. If you don’t specify the file name of the destination file, the OS assigns
the file’s original name to this copy. If you omit the drive or path of the source or the destination, then the OS uses
the current default drive and path.
To copy the file myfile.txt from the root directory of drive C: to drive E:, use the following command:
C:\> copy myfile.txt E:

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Because the command does not include a drive or path before the file name myfile.txt, the OS assumes that the
file is in the default drive and path. Also, because there is no destination file name specified, the file written to drive
E: will be named myfile.txt.
To copy all files in the C:\Docs directory to the USB flash drive designated drive E:, use the following command:
C:\> copy c:\docs\*.* E:
To make a backup file named system.bak of the SYSTEM registry hive file in the \Windows\System32\config
directory of the hard drive, use the following command:
C:\Windows\system32\config> copy system system.bak
If you use the copy command to duplicate multiple files, the files are assigned the names of the original files.
When you duplicate multiple files, the destination portion of the command line cannot include a file name.
Here are two parameters that are useful with the copy command:
●● /v. When the /v switch is used, the size of each new file is compared with the size of the original file. This
slows down the copying but verifies that the copy is done without errors.
●● /y. When the /y switch is used, a confirmation message does not ask you to confirm before overwriting a file.
When trying to recover a corrupted file, you can sometimes use the copy command to copy the file to new media, such
as from the hard drive to a USB drive. If the copy command reports a bad or missing sector during the copying process,
choose the option to ignore that sector. The copying process then continues to the next sector. The corrupted sector
will be lost, but others can likely be recovered. The recover command can be used to accomplish the same thing.
Note 23
XCOPY <Source> [<Destination>] [/S] [/E] [/C] [/Y] [/D:[Date]]
The xcopy command is more powerful than the copy command. It follows the same general command-sourcedestination format as the copy command, but it offers several more options. Table 13-4 shows some of these options.
Command Result
xcopy C:\docs\*.* E: /s Uses the /s parameter to include subdirectories in the copy; this sample
command copies all files in the directory C:\docs, as well as all subdirectories
under \docs and their files, to drive E:, unless the subdirectory is empty
xcopy C:\docs\*.* E: /e Works the same as /s but empty subdirectories are included in the copy
xcopy C:\docs\*.* E: /d :03-14-2022 Uses the /d switch to examine the date; this sample command copies all files
from the directory C:\docs created or modified on or after March 14, 2022
xcopy C:\docs\*.* E: /y Uses the /y switch to overwrite existing files without prompting
xcopy C:\docs\*.* E: /c Uses the /c switch to keep copying even when an error occurs
Table 13-4 Sample xcopy commands
Robocopy <Source> <Destination> [/S] [/E] [/Log:<Logfile>] [/Log1:<Logfile>]
[/Move] [/Purge]
The robocopy (robust file copy) command is similar to the xcopy command. It offers more options than xcopy and
is intended to replace xcopy. A few options for robocopy are listed in Table 13-5.

Commands to Manage Hard Drives
Core 2 Objective 1.2
Several commands can be used to manage hard drives when setting up a new hard drive, refreshing a hard drive, or
troubleshooting. Sometimes these commands are easier than digging through menus for a needed utility. If you’re
restricted to the Windows Recovery Environment during troubleshooting, these commands might be your only
means of accessing some of these tools.
CHKDSK [<Volume>:] [/F] [/R]
The chkdsk (check disk) command fixes file system errors and recovers data from bad sectors. Recall that a file is
stored on the hard drive as a group of clusters. The FAT32 and exFAT file systems use a FAT (file allocation table) to
keep a record of each cluster that belongs to a file. In Figure 13-32, you can see that each cell in the FAT represents
one cluster and contains a pointer to the next cluster in a file. The NTFS file system uses a database called the master
file table (MFT) to hold similar information.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Used with the /f parameter, chkdsk searches for and fixes two types of file system errors made by the FAT or MFT:
●● Lost clusters (also called lost allocation units). Lost clusters are clusters that are marked as used in the
FAT or MFT, but they do not belong to any file. In effect, the data in these clusters is lost.
●● Cross-linked clusters. Cross-linked clusters are marked in the FAT or MFT as belonging to more than one file.
Used with the /r parameter, chkdsk checks for lost clusters, cross-linked clusters, and bad sectors on the drive.
The FAT and MFT keep a table of bad sectors that they normally do not use. However, over time, a sector might
become unreliable. If chkdsk determines that a sector is unreliable, it attempts to recover the data from the sector
and marks the sector as bad so the FAT or MFT will not use it again.
Used without any parameters, the chkdsk command only reports information about a drive and does not make
any repairs.
An elevated command prompt is required to use the chkdsk command. In the following sample commands, the
command prompt is not shown because the default drive and directory are not important. To check the hard drive
for file system errors and repair them, use this command:
chkdsk C:/f
To redirect a report of the findings of the chkdsk command to a file that you can later print, use this command:
chkdsk C: >Myfile.txt
Use the /r parameter of the chkdsk command to fix file system errors and examine each sector of the drive for
bad sectors, like so:
chkdsk C: /r
If chkdsk finds data that it can recover, it asks
you for permission to do so. If you give permission, it
saves the recovered data in files that it stores in the
root directory of the drive.
The chkdsk command will not fix anything unless
the drive is locked, which means the drive has no
open files. If you attempt to use chkdsk with the /f or
/r parameter when files are open, chkdsk alerts you
to the problem and asks permission to schedule the
run the next time Windows is restarted. Know that the
process will take plenty of time.
Format <Volume:>[/Q] [FS:<Filesystem>]
You can format a hard drive or other storage device using Disk Management. In addition, you can use the format
command from a command prompt window and from the Windows Recovery Environment. This high-level format
installs a file system on the device and erases all data on the volume. Table 13-6 lists various sample uses of the
format command.
Use either the /f or /r parameter, but not both, with
chkdsk. Using both parameters is redundant. For the
most thorough check of a drive, use /r.
Note 24
The chkdsk command is also available from the Windows
Recovery Environment.
Note 25
Command Result
format D: Performs a full format of volume D: using the default file system for the volume type

Prepare a Corrupted Hard Drive for a Clean Windows Installation
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.2
Windows setup is not always able to overwrite or repair a corrupted partition table on a hard drive. To practice
using the diskpart command to prepare a corrupted hard drive for a clean installation of Windows, do the following:
1. Using a VM you have already created in this course, add a second hard drive to the VM. Start the VM and
open an elevated command prompt window.
2. Enter the diskpart command. At the diskpart prompt, enter the commands shown in Table 13-7 to
clean all partitions off the drive, create a new partition, and format it using the NTFS file system. Then
open Explorer in your VM, and verify that the second hard drive is present and available for use.

Module Summary
Critical Windows Settings and Backup Procedures
●● Regular preventive maintenance includes verifying Windows Update, anti-malware, and network security
settings, as well as backup routines. In addition, uninstall software you no longer need, and clean up and
optimize the hard drive.
●● Use the Power Options app in Control Panel to control power settings in a laptop.
●● You need a plan for disaster recovery in the event the hard drive fails. This plan needs to include routine
backups of data files and possibly the entire Windows volume, critical applications, and system files.
●● Three types of backups are full, incremental, and differential backups.
●● You can back up to local storage or to the cloud. Best practice is to maintain two backups and keep one backup
off site. This is known as the 3-2-1 backup rule (three copies, two backup media, and one kept off site).
●● Regularly test your backup plan to make sure you can recover files if needed.
●● Windows File History and Backup and Restore can be used to schedule routine backups of user data files
on a workstation. Both tools can back up a system image. Neither tool can maintain more than one backup
routine.
●● The best time to create a system image is right after you’ve installed Windows, hardware, applications, and
user accounts and customized Windows settings.
●● System Protection creates restore points, which include Windows system files that have changed since the
last restore point was made.
Maintaining Hard Drives
●● Use File Explorer Options to unhide files and file extensions that are hidden by default in Explorer.
●● To improve hard drive performance, use the Disk Cleanup tool and the Defragment and Optimize Drives
tool to clean and optimize the drive.
●● Use Indexing Options to control which file types are indexed, which can speed up searches but potentially
slow down overall system performance.
●● Use Disk Management to manage hard drives and partitions. Use it to create, delete, and resize partitions,
mount a drive, manage dynamic disks, and solve problems with hard drives.

Shutdown [/I] [/R] [/S] [/M \\<Computername>] [/T XX]
Use the shutdown command to shut down the local computer or a remote computer. You must be signed in with
an administrator account to use this command. By default, the command gives users a 30-second warning before
shutdown. To shut down a remote computer on the network, you must have an administrator account on that computer and be signed on the local computer with that same account and password. Table 13-8 lists some shutdown
commands.

Using a Command-Line Interface (CLI)
●● Commands can use wildcard characters ? and * to apply the command to a group of files or to abbreviate
a file name.
●● Commands used to manage files, folders, and storage media include help, dir, cd, md, del, attrib, rmdir, copy,
xcopy, and robocopy, The winver command displays the About Windows box.
●● Commands to manage hard drives include chkdsk, format, and diskpart. The shutdown command shuts
down the system.

Creating a Virtual Hard Drive
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.3
You can use the Disk Management tool or the diskpart command to create a virtual hard drive (VHD) on a physical
computer. The VHD is a file that takes up some free space on the physical hard drive, but to the Windows interface,
it appears as a second hard drive. You can store data in folders and files on the VHD and even install Windows in
the VHD. Follow these steps to create a VHD:
1. In Disk Management, click Action in the menu bar and click Create VHD. Follow the on-screen directions
to create the VHD, specifying its location on the hard drive and its size. You can make the size dynamically
expanding. The VHD is listed as a Disk in the Disk Management window.
2. Right-click the new disk and click Initialize Disk. Use the GPT partitioning system for the disk.
3. To format the disk, right-click the unallocated space on the disk, and click New Simple Volume. The VHD is
now ready for use.
4. Open Explorer and verify you can access the new volume.
Discuss in your class and research online how a VHD might be useful. What are two uses of a VHD in which it
offers advantages over using a physical hard drive?

Introduction
Windows installed in a virtual machine is an excellent environment to use when practicing the skills in this module.
Note 1
Windows Under the Hood
Core 2 Objective 1.3
Knowledge is power when it comes to supporting Windows. In this part of the module, you learn more about how
Windows works and how it is structured. We also survey several Windows tools that are useful when solving a problem with Windows, applications, Windows users, and hardware. In later parts of the module, you learn to use these
tools to solve typical problems you might encounter as an IT technician supporting Windows.
What Are the Shell and the Kernel?
Core 2 Objective 1.3
It might sound like we’re talking about a grain of wheat, but Windows has a shell and a kernel, and you need to
understand what they are and how they work so you can solve problems with each. A shell is the portion of an OS
that relates to the user and to applications. The kernel is responsible for interacting with hardware. Figure 14-1 shows
how the shell and kernel relate to users, applications, and hardware. In addition, the figure shows a third component
of an OS, the configuration data. For Windows, this data is primarily contained in the registry.
The Windows Shell
The shell provides tools such as File Explorer and the Windows desktop as a way for the user to do such things
as play music or launch an application. For applications, the shell provides commands and procedures that
applications can call on to do such things as print a document, read from a storage device, or display a photo on
the screen.
The shell is made up of several subsystems that all operate in user mode, which means these subsystems have
only limited access to system information and can access hardware only through other OS services. One of these
subsystems, the Win32 security subsystem, provides sign-in to the system as well as other security functions, including privileges for file access. All applications relate to Windows by way of the Win32 subsystem.
The Windows Kernel
The kernel, or core, of the OS is responsible for interacting with hardware. Because the kernel operates in kernel
mode, it has more power to communicate with hardware devices than the shell has. Applications operating under
In previous modules, you learned about the tools and strategies to install and maintain Windows and about the
importance of keeping good backups. This module takes you one step further as an IT support technician so
you can use Windows tools and methods to solve problems with Windows, applications, and hardware. This
module is about problems that occur after startup. Troubleshooting Windows startup is covered in the module
“Troubleshooting Windows Startup.” We begin the module by learning about the Windows concepts and tools
you’ll need to optimize and troubleshoot Windows. Then we turn our attention to general steps you can follow
when solving Windows, applications, and hardware problems. Finally, we move on to specific problems you
might encounter and how to solve them. As you read the module, you might consider following along using a
Windows 10 system.

In Task Manager, the Windows processes group on the Processes tab shows that the Windows kernel process
ntoskrnl.exe appears as System.
Note 2
When Windows is first installed, it builds the HAL based on the type of CPU installed. The HAL cannot be moved
from one computer to another, which is one reason you cannot copy a Windows installation from one computer to
another.
the OS cannot get to hardware devices without the shell passing those requests to the kernel. This separation
of tasks provides for a more stable system and helps to prevent a wayward application from destabilizing the
system.
The kernel has two main components: (1) the HAL (hardware abstraction layer), which is the layer closest
to the hardware, and (2) the executive services interface, which is a group of services that operate in kernel
mode between the user mode subsystems and the HAL. Executive services contained in the ntoskrnl.exe program
file manage memory, I/O devices, file systems, some security, and other key components directly or by way of
device drivers.

Directory Structures
Core 2 Objective 1.3
Folder or directory locations you need to be aware of include those for user files, program files, and Windows data.
In the folder locations given in this discussion, we assume Windows is installed on drive C:.
User Profile Namespace
When a user first signs in to Windows, a user profile is created. This collection of user data and settings consists of
two general items:
● A user folder together with its subfolders. These items are created under the C:\Users folder—for example,
C:\Users\Jean Andrews. This folder contains a group of subfolders collectively called the user profile
namespace. (In general, a namespace is a container to hold data—for example, a folder.)
● NTUSER.DAT. NTUSER.DAT is a hidden file stored in the C:\Users\username folder that contains user settings. Each time the user signs in, the contents of this file are copied to a location in the registry.
Program Files
Here is where Windows stores program files unless you select a different location when a program is installed:
● Program files are stored in C:\Program Files for 32-bit versions of Windows. Only 32-bit applications can be
installed in a 32-bit installation of Windows.
● In 64-bit versions of Windows, 64-bit programs are stored in the C:\Program Files folder, and 32-bit programs
are stored in the C:\Program Files (x86) folder. (For best performance, when you have the option, install
64-bit applications in a 64-bit installation of Windows.)
Here are folders that applications and some utilities use to launch programs at startup:
● A program file or shortcut to a program file stored in the C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\
Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder launches at startup for an individual user.
● A program file or shortcut to a program file stored in the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\
Programs\Startup folder launches at startup for all users.
Folders for Windows Data
An operating system needs a place to keep hardware and software configuration information, user preferences, and
application settings. This information is used when the OS is first loaded and when needed by hardware, applications, and users. Windows uses a database called the registry for most of this information. In addition, Windows
keeps some data in text files called initialization files, which often have an .ini or .inf file extension.
Here are some important folder locations used for the registry and other Windows data:
● Registry location. The Windows registry is stored in the C:\Windows\System32\config folder.
● Backup of the registry. A backup of the registry is stored in the C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack
folder.
● Fonts. Fonts are stored in the C:\Windows\Fonts folder.
● Temporary files. These files, which are used by Windows when it is installing software and performing other
maintenance tasks, are stored in the C:\Windows\Temp folder.
Most often, Windows is installed on drive C:. If the drive letter of the Windows volume is not known, it is written
in Microsoft documentation as %SystemDrive%. For example, the location of the Program Files folder is written as
%SystemDrive%\Program Files.

Survey of Windows Tools and Techniques
for Troubleshooting
Core 2 Objectives 1.3, 1.4
With an understanding of how Windows is structured, let’s turn our attention to useful tools and techniques for
managing and troubleshooting Windows, applications, users, hardware, and networks. Table 14-1 lists many of these
tools. As you read through the list, try to form a context for how you might use a tool to help you solve a Windowsrelated problem. To get started, launch each tool and take a look at how its window is organized, the basic functions
available, and what is on each tab in a window. Later in the module, you learn how to apply each tool as you address
many typical Windows problems.

How Windows Manages Applications
Core 2 Objective 1.3
When an application is first installed, its program files are normally stored on the hard drive. When the application
is launched, the program is copied from the hard drive into memory, and there it is called a process. A process is a
program that is running under the authority of the shell, together with the system resources assigned to it. System
resources might include other programs the process has started and memory addresses to hold its data. When the
process makes a request for resources, this request is made to the Win32 subsystem and is called a thread. A thread
is a single task, such as the task of printing a file that the process requests from the kernel. Figure 14-2 shows two
threads in action, which is possible because the process and Windows support multithreading. Sometimes a process
is called an instance, such as when you say to a user, “Open two instances of Microsoft Edge.” Technically, you are
saying to open two Microsoft Edge processes.

Tool Description
Use these tools to conveniently access and manage other Windows tools:
Control Panel Control Panel is a collection of small programs, called applets, that are used
to manage many Windows settings. You learned to use Control Panel in the
module “Installing Windows.”
Administrative Tools or Windows
Tools
This applet in Control Panel contains several tools used by IT technicians. You
need to be signed in to Windows with administrator privileges to use many
of these tools. The applet is called Administrative Tools in Windows 10 and
Windows Tools in Windows 11.
Computer Management
(compmgmt.msc)
This console contains several administrative tools, including those that manage
users and user groups.
Microsoft Management Console
(MMC, mmc.exe)
Use this console to build your own customized console window where you can
add Windows tools you use often for handy access.
Use these tools to observe Windows, Windows user, network, application, and hardware activities as tracked
and logged by Windows:
Event Viewer
(eventvwr.msc)
Just about anything that happens in Windows is logged by Windows, and these
logs can be viewed using Event Viewer in the Administrative Tools/Windows
Tools group.
Resource Monitor
(resmon.exe)
Resource Monitor monitors the CPU, hard drive, network, and memory in real
time. If you suspect CPU, memory, hard drive, or network resources are being
used excessively by an application or malware, you can use Resource Monitor
to identify the process. You can access the tool on the Performance tab of Task
Manager or in the Administrative Tools/Windows Tools group.
Performance Monitor
(perfmon.msc)
Performance Monitor in the Administrative Tools/Windows Tools group can
track activity by hardware and software to measure performance.
Solve Windows, application, networking, and Windows user problems with these tools:
Task Manager
(taskmgr.exe)
Task Manager lets you view applications, processes, and network and user
activities. You can use it to end a process or to enable or disable a process.
Services console
(services.msc)
Use the Services console in the Administrative Tools/Windows Tools group to
control Windows and third-party services installed on a system.
System Configuration
(msconfig.exe)
Use the System Configuration utility (commonly called “M-S-config”) to
temporarily disable programs from launching at startup and to perform
a clean boot or Safe boot.
Registry Editor (regedit.exe) Use the Registry Editor to back up and edit the Windows registry.
Solve Windows problems using these tools and techniques:
System File Checker
(sfc.exe)
Use System File Checker (SFC) to verify and replace Windows system files. It
keeps a cache of current system files in case it needs to refresh a damaged file.
Windows Updates Use Windows Updates in the Settings app to download and apply the
latest Windows updates to solve problems with Windows, applications, and
hardware.
System Restore
(rstrui.exe)
Use System Restore to revert the system back to a previously saved restore
point before a problem started.
Solve application errors or crashes with these tools and techniques:
Programs and Features
(appwiz.cpl)
Use the Programs and Features tool in Control Panel to repair and uninstall
applications and enable and disable Windows features.

Exam Tip
If an often-used Windows utility can be launched from a command prompt, the A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know
the program name of that utility.
If you have not already used a tool listed in Table 14-1, open the tool, and take a good look at its features and menus
before you continue with the module. If you can, open each tool using more than one method. Try to remember at
least one way to open it. Don’t worry if you don’t know how to use the tool—that’s coming up.
Note 4
Tool Description
Secondary logon Use a secondary logon using administrator privileges to run an application
that refused to run under the authority of a standard user. Use the Properties
dialog box of the application program file to perform a secondary logon.
Digital signature A digital signature verifies that the application is not a rogue application
and that it is certified as Windows-compatible by Microsoft. Verify a digital
signature using the Properties dialog box of the application program file.
Task Scheduler
(taskschd.msc)
Use Task Scheduler in the Administrative Tools/Windows Tools group to
schedule a program to run at a future time, including at startup.
Manage and solve problems with hardware using these tools:
Device Manager (devmgmt.msc) Device Manager in Control Panel is the go-to tool to make sure Windows has
correctly installed a hardware device and to solve problems with a device.
chkdsk The chkdsk command checks the hard drive for a corrupted file system and
bad sectors on the drive. Use the chkdsk c: /r command to check drive C: and
recover data.
Table 14-1 Tools and techniques to solve Windows-related problems (Continued)
Exam Tip
In performance-based questions on the A1 Core 2 exam, you are expected to know how to access a Windows tool using
more than one method. It’s a good idea to know the command that launches a given tool.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam gives you a scenario with possible alternatives toward a solution. It expects you to know which
Windows tool to use and how to use it to resolve a problem. These Windows tools covered in this module include Event
Viewer, MMC, Performance Monitor, the Registry Editor, Resource Monitor, the Services console, System Configuration,
System File Checker, System Restore, Task Manager, and Task Scheduler.
Now let’s learn to use a few of these tools. You’ll learn to use other Windows tools later in this and other
modules.

Using Windows Tools to Manage Tools
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.3
Windows offers several windows and consoles to help access and organize Windows tools. Take a quick look at each
to get familiar with how a window or console works and the tools each one contains:
1. Administrative Tools/Windows Tools. In Classic view of Control Panel, click Administrative Tools in
Windows 10 or Windows Tools in Windows 11 to see a group of tools used by technicians and developers
to support Windows. Figure 14-3 shows the Administrative Tools window for Windows 10 Pro. The Home
editions of Windows don’t include several of these tools, including Hyper-V Manager, Local Security Policy,
and Print Management.
Applying Concepts
Figure 14-3 Administrative tools available in Windows 10 Pro
2. Computer Management. One of the items in Administrative Tools/Windows Tools is Computer
Management (compmgmt.msc), which itself contains several tools to manage the local computer
or other computers on the network. The window is called a console because it consolidates several
Windows administrative tools. To use most of these tools, you must be signed in as an administrator,
although you can view certain settings in Computer Management if you are signed in with lesser
privileges. The Windows 10 Computer Management window is shown in Figure 14-4.

Note 5
Let’s turn our attention to three tools you can use to examine the system: Event Viewer, Resource Monitor, and
Performance Monitor.
3. Microsoft Management Console (MMC). You can build your own console to hold the tools you use
often, and you can copy this console to any computer you support. To build a console, first sign in to
Windows using an account with administrator privileges, and then open the Microsoft Management
Console (MMC; the program file is mmc.exe). A new empty console is created, as shown in Figure 14-5.
Tools you add to your console are called snap-ins, and the console is saved in a file with an .msc file
extension. You learn to create your own console in a project at the end of this module.

Use Event Viewer to Look for Clues
Core 2 Objective 1.3
Get in the habit of checking Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) as one of your first steps when you encounter a Windows,
hardware, application, or security problem. Event Viewer provides access to logs about hardware or network failure, OS error messages, a device or service that has failed to start, and general protection faults, which can cause
Windows to lock up or hang.
Here are general steps to use Event Viewer:
1. To Open Event Viewer, right-click the Start menu and click Event Viewer or run the eventvwr.msc
command. To see events, select a log in the left pane, and then drill down into subcategories of these logs.
For example, Figure 14-6 shows events in the Administrative Events log. Select an event to see more about it. In
the figure, the selected event is that the computer was not able to lease an IP address from the DHCP server.
Figure 14-6 Use Event Viewer to see logs about hardware, Windows, security, and application events
2. To sort a list of events, click a column heading in the middle pane. After you have selected an event,
click the Details tab to show more information about the event.
The types of events are Critical, Error, Warning, Information, and Audit Success. Error events are the most important
and indicate something went wrong with the system, such as a scheduled backup failing to work. Warning events indicate failure might occur in the future, and Critical events indicate a problem occurred with a critical Windows process.
Here are the logs that are the most useful:
● Administrative Events log. This filtered log shows only Critical, Error, and Warning events intended for the
administrator. This log is in the Custom Views category and is selected in Figure 14-6.
● Application log. In the Windows Logs group, look in the Application log for events recorded by an application. This log might help you identify why an application is causing problems.
● Security log. Events in the Security log are called audits, and they include successful and unsuccessful
sign-ins to a user account and attempts from another computer on the network to access shared resources
on this computer.
● Setup log. Look in the Setup log for events recorded at the time applications are installed.
● System log. Look in the System log to find events triggered by Windows components, such as a device driver
failing to load or a problem with hardware.
● Forwarded Events log. This log receives events that were recorded on other computers and sent to this
computer.
To save time, first check the Administrative Events log because it filters out all events except Critical, Error,
and Warning events.

Performance Monitor Tracks Resource Use Over Time
Core 2 Objective 1.3
Performance Monitor (perfmon.msc) also tracks how resources are used in real time, and it can save collected data
in logs for future use. Software developers might use this tool to evaluate how well their software is performing and
to identify software and hardware bottlenecks.
To open Performance Monitor, click it in the Administrative Tools/Windows Tools group or enter the perfmon.msc
command. Performance Monitor offers hundreds of counters used to examine many aspects of the system related
to performance. The Windows default setting is to show the % Processor Time counter the first time you open the
window (see Figure 14-8). This counter appears as a red line in the graph and tracks activity of the processor.
Figure 14-7 View how computer resources are being allocated and used
Resource Monitor Can Identify a Resource-Hungry Process
Core 2 Objective 1.3
Do you suspect a sluggish system is caused by a process hogging system resources? For a quick look, in the Administrative Tools/Windows Tools window, open Resource Monitor to view in real time how the CPU, hard drive, network, and memory are being used (see Figure 14-7). If you suspect CPU, memory, disk, or network resources are
being used excessively by a process, you can use Resource Monitor to identify the process. Click individual tabs in
this window to drill down for more detail. Check for such a process if you suspect malware might be at work in a
denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

Figure 14-8 Performance Monitor uses counters to monitor various activities
of hardware and software
Figure 14-9 Add counters to set up what Performance Monitor tracks
Allow Performance Monitor to keep running while the system is in use, and then check the counters. The results
for one system are shown in Figure 14-10. Select each counter and note the average, minimum, and maximum values
for the counter.
To keep from unnecessarily using system resources, only use the counters you really need. For example, if you
suspect the hard drive is slowing down the entire system, do the following to track hard drive performance:
1. Remove the % Processor Time counter. To delete a counter, select it from the list so that it is
highlighted, and click the red X above the graph.
2. Click the green plus sign above the graph to add counters. In the Add Counters dialog box, expand the
LogicalDisk group. To track the percentage of time the hard drive is in use, select % Disk Time, and click
Add. To track the average number of processes waiting to use the drive, select Avg. Disk Queue Length,
and click Add. Figure 14-9 shows the Add Counters dialog box with two counters added. After all your
counters are added, click OK.

Figure 14-10 Two counters can measure hard drive performance
Task Manager Shows You What’s Happening Now
Core 2 Objective 1.3
Task Manager lets you view activities of applications, processes, the CPU, memory, hard drives, networks, and
users. Use Task Manager to end a process causing trouble and to enable or disable programs that launch at Windows
startup. It’s a powerful tool that technicians rely on to view and control what’s happening now in Windows.
Here are two ways to open Task Manager:
● Press Ctrl1Alt1Del. Depending on your system, the security screen (see Figure 14-11) or Task Manager
appears. If the security screen appears, click Task Manager. This method works well when the system has
a problem and is frozen.
● Right-click the Start menu and click Task Manager.
Figure 14-11 Use the security screen to launch Task Manager
To find out which counters to use to measure specific performances, search the Microsoft website or perform a general
web search.
Note 6
If the % Disk Time is more than 80% and the Avg. Disk Queue Length is more than two, you can conclude that
the hard drive is working excessively hard and processes are slowed down waiting on the drive. Any time a process
must wait to access the hard drive, you are likely to see degradation in overall system performance.

If you see very limited information in the Task Manager window, click More details to see the details on the
Processes tab shown in Figure 14-14.
When working with a virtual machine, you cannot send the Ctrl1Alt1Del keystrokes to the guest operating system in
the VM because these keystrokes are always sent to the host operating system. To send the Ctrl1Alt1Del keystrokes to
a VM in Windows Client Hyper-V, click the Action menu in the VM window, and click Ctrl1Alt1Del (see Figure 14-12).
The module “Installing Windows” covers how to install Windows in a VM in Client Hyper-V.
To send the Ctrl1Alt1Del keystrokes to a VM in Oracle VirtualBox, click Input in the menu bar at the top of the VM
window. For the system shown in Figure 14-13A, you can see the keystrokes to press for Ctrl1Alt1Del are Host1Del.
By default, the Host key in VirtualBox is the Right Ctrl key. To verify the Host key for your installation of VirtualBox, look
in the bottom-right corner of the VM window (see Figure 14-13B).

to the Details tab (see Figure 14-15), where you see the name of the program file and other details about the
running program. On the Details tab, a hung process is reported as Not Responding. To end the task, select
it and click End task. The application will attempt a normal shutdown; if data has not been saved, you are
given the opportunity to save it.

If you want to end a process and all related processes, click the Details tab, right-click the process, and select
End Process Tree from the shortcut menu. Be careful not to end critical Windows processes; ending these might
crash your system.
If your desktop locks up, you can use Task Manager to refresh it. To do so, press Ctrl1Alt1Del and open Task Manager.
Click the Processes tab. In the Windows processes group, select Windows Explorer and click Restart. (Task Manager
calls Explorer “Windows Explorer.”)
Note 8
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to understand the purposes of the Processes, Performance, Startup, Users, and
Services tabs in Task Manager and know when to use a tab to resolve a problem in a given scenario.
Figure 14-16 Use the Performance tab to view system resource usage
● Performance tab. The Performance tab of Task Manager (see Figure 14-16) allows you to monitor performance of key devices in the system and network connections. For example, Figure 14-16 shows the CPU
selected, which allows you to monitor what percentage of CPU resources are in use. You can also see
whether Hardware-assisted Virtualization is enabled. Also notice the link to open the Resource Monitor,
which can identify each process using system resources. Check for such a process if you suspect malware
might be at work in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
● Startup tab. The Startup tab is used to manage startup items (see Figure 14-17). Click a white arrow to
expand the items in a group. To disable a program from launching at startup, select it and click Disable at
the bottom of the window or in the shortcut menu. To see the program file location, right-click it and click
Open file location, as shown in the figure.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Users tab. The Users tab (see Figure 14-18) lists currently signed-in users. Expand the list for a user to
show processes started by the user that might be affecting overall system performance. Notice that the
statuses of some programs on this tab are listed as Suspended. If certain apps remain idle for a short time,
they’re suspended so they don’t require the attention of the CPU. When the app is used again, it automatically comes out of suspension, and the CPU once again begins servicing it. To disconnect a remote user
or sign out a local user from the system, select the user and click Disconnect or Sign out at the bottom of
the screen.

Services Console Manages Services
Core 2 Objective 1.3
Although you can temporarily solve a problem with a service using Task Manager, use the Services console
(services.msc) to permanently adjust when services run in the background to support Windows and applications.
To open the console, enter the services.msc command in the Windows search box. If the Extended tab at the
bottom of the window is not selected, click it (see Figure 14-20). This tab gives a description of a selected service.

When you click a service to select it and the description is missing, it’s most likely a third-party service put there
by an installed application; in fact, it might be malware. To get more information about a service or to stop or start a
service, right-click its name and select Properties from the shortcut menu. In the Properties box (see Figure 14-20),
the startup types for a service are as follows:
● Automatic (Delayed Start). Starts shortly after startup and after the user signs in, so as not to slow down
the startup process
● Automatic. Starts when Windows loads
● Manual. Starts as needed
● Disabled. Cannot be started
Use the Services console to make sure the service an application requires has started. If the service has failed
to start, make sure it has an Automatic or Manual setting. If problems with the service or application persist, you
might need to reinstall the service or the application that uses the service.
Other problems with a service can sometimes be resolved by stopping and restarting the service. For example,
stopping and restarting the Spooler service might solve a problem with print jobs not moving on to the printer. To
stop or restart, right-click the service and use the shortcut menu.
Task Scheduler Manages Startup Programs
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.3
Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc) in the Administrative Tools/Windows Tools group of Control Panel is used to schedule a program to run at startup or some other time in the future. Application installations, including malware, can put
an item in Task Scheduler. When solving a problem with a sluggish Windows system, always check Task Scheduler
to remove unnecessarily scheduled tasks from Windows startup. Do the following to learn about this tool:
1. Task Scheduler stores tasks in files and subfolders in the C:\Windows\System32\Tasks folder. Open
Explorer and drill down into this folder to see the list of scheduled task files. One example is shown in
Figure 14-21.
Applying Concepts
Figure 14-21 The Tasks folder contains tasks managed by Task Scheduler

System File Checker
Core 2 Objective 1.2
Use the System File Checker (SFC) command to repair the Windows 10/11 system. The tool scans for and replaces
corrupted or missing Windows system files, which include device drivers for many hardware devices. It cannot harm
Windows, and it sometimes can solve problems with an unstable Windows system or essential hardware devices.
To run SFC, close all applications, open an elevated command prompt window, and enter the sfc /scannow
command (see Figure 14-23). If corrupted system files are found, the tool attempts to retrieve copies from its cache
or download them through Windows Update.
Figure 14-23 Use System File Checker to verify Windows system files
Recall from the module “Maintaining Windows” that to get an elevated command prompt window, type cmd in the
search box, right-click Command Prompt, and click Run as administrator.
Note 10
If you have problems running the SFC utility, use System Configuration to boot the computer into Safe boot, and
run the sfc /scannow command again in Safe Mode. If you still have problems, the DISM command might help.
You learn to use DISM in a project at the end of this module.
System Configuration Offers Clean Boot and Safe Mode
Core 2 Objective 1.3
Use System Configuration (msconfig.exe) in the Administrative Tools/Windows Tools group to control Windows
startup, including temporarily disabling programs from launching at startup. Doing so can help troubleshoot a
startup problem or solve a problem with a sluggish Windows system. Do the following to learn more:
1. To open System Configuration, enter the msconfig.exe command. The System Configuration box
is shown in Figure 14-24 with the General tab selected. Notice that Selective startup is selected, which
means some items that would normally be launched at startup have been disabled. If you want a normal
startup that loads all drivers and services, select Normal startup.

Safe Mode, also called Safe boot, goes beyond a clean boot by eliminating third-party software and
also reducing startup to only the Windows minimum configuration necessary to start the OS. It can create
a stable environment when the Windows system or device drivers become corrupted. There are several
ways to start Safe Mode, which you learn about in the module “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.” One
way is to open System Configuration, click the Boot tab, and check Safe boot (see Figure 14-26). If the
application in question needs the Internet to work, select Network. Click OK and restart the system.
If the application works in Safe Mode, you can assume the problem is not with the application but
with the operating system or device drivers.

System Restore
Core 2 Objective 3.1
If you know the approximate date a Windows or application error started and that date is in the recent past, you
can use System Restore (rstrui.exe) to restore the system to a point just before the problem started. Reverting to
a restore point can solve problems with corrupted registry entries used by applications, device driver updates, or
other Windows problems. However, System Restore can cause problems of its own, so use it with caution. Keep
these points in mind:
● System Restore might make many changes to a system. If you know which change caused a problem, try to
undo that particular change first. The idea is to use the least invasive solution first. For example, if updating
a driver has caused a problem, first use Device Manager to perform a driver rollback and undo that change.
● System Restore won’t help you if you don’t have restore points to use. System Protection must be turned
on so that restore points are automatically created.
● Restore points replace certain keys in the registry but cannot completely rebuild a totally corrupted registry.
Therefore, System Restore can recover from errors only if the registry is somewhat intact.
● The restore process cannot remove a virus or worm infection. However, it might help you start a system that
is infected with a virus that launches at startup. After Windows has started, you can then use anti-malware
software to remove the infection.
● System Restore might create a new problem. Often when using a restore point, anti-malware software gets
out of whack and sometimes even needs reinstalling. Therefore, use restore points sparingly.
● Restore points are kept in a hidden folder on the hard drive. If that area of the drive is corrupted, the restore
points are lost. Also, if a user turns System Protection off, all restore points are lost.
● Viruses and other malware sometimes hide in restore points. To completely clean an infected system, you
need to delete all restore points by turning System Protection off and back on.
● If Windows will not start, you can launch System Restore using startup recovery tools, which are covered
in the module “Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”
System Configuration reports only what it is programmed to look for when listing startup programs and services. It
looks only in certain registry keys and startup folders and sometimes does not report a startup process. Therefore,
don’t consider its list of startup processes to be complete.
Note 11
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam gives you a scenario and expects you to know when and how to use System Restore to solve a
Windows, hardware, or application problem within that scenario.
Here’s how to use System Restore:
1. Enter the rstrui.exe command. The System Restore box appears and shows the most recent restore
point (see Figure 14-28).

Registry Editor
Core 2 Objective 1.3
The Registry Editor (regedit.exe) is used to manually change the Windows registry. As an IT technician, you
might be called on to edit the registry for a variety of purposes—if, for example, the Microsoft Edge browser
gives an error and the Microsoft website tells you the problem can be solved by changing a particular value in
a registry key.
Items in the registry are called keys, which are assigned values. A technician might need to remove a key or
change its value. Let’s learn how to manually edit the registry by first looking at how the registry is organized.
How the Registry Is Organized
The registry is the most important Windows component that holds information for Windows. The registry is a database designed with a treelike structure (called a hierarchical database) that contains configuration information for
Windows, users, software applications, and installed hardware devices. During startup, Windows builds the registry
in memory and keeps it there until Windows shuts down. During startup, after the registry is built, Windows reads
from it to obtain information to complete the startup process. After Windows is loaded, it continually reads from
many of the subkeys in the registry.
Windows builds the registry from the current hardware configuration and from information it takes from the
following files:
● Five files stored in the C:\Windows\System32\config folder; these files are called hives, and they are named
the SAM (Security Accounts Manager), SECURITY, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, and DEFAULT hives.
● C:\Users\username\Ntuser.dat file, which holds the preferences and settings of the currently signed-in user.
After the registry is built in memory, it is organized into five high-level keys (see Figure 14-29). Each key
can have subkeys, and subkeys can have more subkeys and can be assigned one or more values. The way data
is organized in the hive files is different from the way it is organized in registry keys. Figure 14-30 shows the
relationship between registry keys and hives. For example, notice that the HKEY_CLASSES_ ROOT key contains
data that comes from the SOFTWARE and DEFAULT hives, and some of this data is also stored in the larger
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key.
2. Do one of the following:
● For most situations, select the
most recent restore point to
make the least possible changes
to your system, and then click
Next.
● To see other restore points,
select Show more restore
points. Select a restore point.
To see a list of programs that
applying this restore point might
affect, click Scan for affected
program, write down the list of
apps you might need to repair
or install again, and then click
Close to close the list.
3. Click Next and then click Finish.
The system restarts and the
restore point is applied.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Here are the five keys, including where they get their data and their purposes:
● HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) is the most important key and contains hardware, software, and security
data. The data is taken from four hives: the SAM hive, the SECURITY hive, the SOFTWARE hive, and the
SYSTEM hive. In addition, the HARDWARE subkey of HKLM is built when the registry is first loaded, based
on data collected about the current hardware configuration.
● HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC) contains information that identifies each hardware device installed on
the computer. Some of the data is gathered from the current hardware configuration when the registry is
first loaded into memory. Other data is taken from the HKLM key, which got its data primarily from the
SYSTEM hive.
● HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR) stores information that determines which application to open when the user
double-clicks a file. This file association relies on the file’s extension. Data for this key is gathered from the
HKLM key and the HKCU key.

● HKEY_USERS (HKU) contains data about all users and is taken from the DEFAULT hive.
● HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) contains data about the current user. The key is built when a user signs in
using data kept in the HKEY_USERS key and in the Ntuser.dat file of the current user.
Device Manager reads data from the HKLM\HARDWARE key to build the information it displays about hardware configurations. You can consider Device Manager to be an easy-to-view presentation of this HARDWARE key data.
Note 12
Before You Edit the Registry, Back It Up!
When you think you need to edit the registry, if possible, first try to make the change from the Windows tool that is
responsible for the key—for example, by using the Programs and Features applet in Control Panel. If that doesn’t work
and you must edit the registry, always back it up first. Changes made to the registry are implemented immediately.
Caution
There is no undo feature in the Registry Editor, and no opportunity to change your mind once the edit is made. Errors
made when editing the registry can do unexpected damage to the system. Be sure to back it up before you edit!
Here are the ways to back up the registry:
● Use System Protection to create a restore point. A restore point keeps information about the registry. You
can restore the system to a restore point to undo registry changes as long as the registry is basically intact
and not too corrupted.
● Back up a single registry key just before you edit the key. This method, called exporting a key, should always
be used before you edit the registry. How to export a key is explained in the steps in the following section.
● Make an extra copy of the C:\Windows\System32\config folder. This is what I call the old-fashioned shotgun approach to backing up the registry. This backup will help if the registry gets totally trashed. You can
boot from Windows setup media and use the Windows Recovery Environment to get a command prompt
window that you can use to restore the folder from your extra copy. This method is drastic and not recommended except in severe cases. Still, just to be on the safe side, you can make an extra copy of this folder
just before you start any serious digging into the registry.
In some situations, such as when you’re going to make drastic changes to the registry, you’ll want to play it safe
and use more than one backup method. Extra registry backups are always a good thing! Now let’s look at how to
back up an individual key in the registry, and then you’ll learn how to edit the registry.
Back Up, Edit, and Restore Individual Keys
A less time-consuming method of backing up the registry is to back up a particular key that you plan to edit. However,
know that if the registry gets corrupted, having a backup of only a particular key most likely will not help you much
when trying a recovery. Also, although you could use this technique to back up the entire registry or an entire tree
within the registry, it is not recommended.
To back up a registry key along with its subkeys, follow these steps:
1. To open the Registry Editor, enter the regedit command and respond to the UAC box. Figure 14-31
shows the Registry Editor with the five main keys and several subkeys listed. Click the triangles on the
left to see subkeys. When you select a subkey, such as KeyboardClass in the figure, the names of the
values in that subkey are displayed in the right pane along with the data assigned to each value.

2. Suppose we want to back up the registry key that contains a list of installed software, which is HKLM\
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall. (HKLM stands for HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE.)
First click the appropriate triangles to navigate to the key. Next, right-click the key and select Export
from the shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 14-32. The Export Registry File dialog box appears.
Figure 14-31 The Registry Editor showing the five main keys, subkeys, values, and data
Figure 14-32 Using the Registry Editor, you can back up a key and its subkeys with the Export command
3. Select the location to save the export file, and name the file. The desktop is a convenient place to store an
export file while you edit the registry. Click Save when done. The saved file will have a .reg file extension.
4. You can now edit a key you have exported or one of its subkeys. To search the registry for keys, values,
and data, click Edit in the menu bar, and then click Find. Locate and select the key in the left pane of the
editor. The values stored in the key display in the right pane.
The full path to a selected key is displayed in the bar at the top of the Registry Editor window. If the bar is missing, click
View in the menu bar, and make sure Address Bar is checked.

Caution
Changes made to the registry take effect immediately. Therefore, take extra care when editing the registry. If you make
a mistake and don’t know how to correct a problem you create, double-click the exported key to recover. When you
double-click an exported key, the registry is updated with the values stored in the key.
With a few tools in hand, let’s tackle some common Windows problems. As we go, you’ll pick up a few more
tools and techniques.
Troubleshooting Windows Problems
Core 2 Objective 3.1
In this part of the module, we begin by listing in Table 14-2 some common problems you might encounter after
Windows 10/11 has started up, along with the tools that might help you find a solution. Then we drill down into the
details of solving these problems. Problems that occur during startup and their solutions are covered in the module
“Troubleshooting Windows Startup.”
Problems Helpful Tools and Techniques
Services not starting Use Task Manager and the Services console, uninstall and reinstall an app or service,
and do a final reboot.
USB controller resource
warnings
Use Device Manager, adjust settings in Power Options, and update the chipset drivers
on the motherboard.
Time drift On a Windows domain, use the Windows Time Service (W32Time) or third-party
software for time accuracy.
Low memory warning Use Task Manager, eliminate or repair an app with a memory leak, update the chipset
drivers on the motherboard, and upgrade memory.
Sluggish performance Use Task Manager, Resource Monitor, and Windows updates. Uninstall or disable
unneeded apps, startup programs, and scheduled tasks. Try a clean boot. Upgrade
hardware.
System instability Use Event Viewer and Windows Update, repair or reinstall an app or service, and use
Windows Memory Diagnostic, chkdsk, System File Checker, and Device Manager. Try
a clean boot, Safe Mode, and System Restore. Repair Windows with a Windows 10/11
upgrade.
Application errors and
crashes
Use Task Manager, taskkill, and uninstall and reinstall the app. Try a secondary logon
and verify the app’s digital signature. To eliminate conflicts with other apps, perform
a clean boot, and then run the app.
Table 14-2 Common Windows problems and solutions after startup
5. To edit, rename, or delete a value, right-click it and select the appropriate option from the shortcut
menu. Changes are immediately applied to the registry, and there is no undo feature. (However, Windows
or applications might need to read the changed value before it affects their operations.)
6. Later, if you need to undo your changes, exit the Registry Editor, and double-click the saved export file.
The key and its subkeys saved in the export file will be restored. After you’re done with an export file,
delete it so no one accidentally double-clicks it and reverts the registry to an earlier setting.

Steps to Solve Any Computer Problem
Core 2 Objective 3.1
You learned about the six steps to solve any computer problem in the Core 1 module “Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer Problems.” Here is a summary of those steps:
● Step 1. Identify the problem. Begin by interviewing the user. Find out if the user has recently changed
anything, and ask what happened around the time the problem started, such as recent thunderstorms and
changes on the network. Also ask if valuable data is on the system, and back it up if necessary.
You need to know A1 Core 1 content about best practices when solving any computer problem in the module “Power
Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer Problems” to do well on the A1 Core 2 exam.
Core to Core
A problem might be caused by an underlying intermittent conflict or other issue. If the user is unable to reproduce the
problem, don’t dismiss the user’s ability to help you understand the nature of the problem. Continue asking the user
questions as you investigate the problem.
Note 14
Working while a customer looks over your shoulder can be awkward. A customer needs the IT support technician to
appear confident and in charge. To maintain your customer’s confidence in your technical abilities, you might want to
find privacy when searching the web or talking with coworkers.
Note 15
● Step 2. Establish your theory of probable cause. Ask the user to reproduce the problem while you watch.
Many problems with applications are caused by user error. Watch carefully as the user shows you the
problem. If you see them making a mistake, be tactful as you explain the problem and its solution.
Try these things to discover the cause of the problem:
1. Reboot the system. Reboots solve a lot of application problems, and one might be a shortcut to your
solution. (Before you restart the system, be sure to ask the user if they need to save their work.) Look
for error messages that appear during Windows startup.
2. Use Event Viewer, Task Manager, and Resource Monitor. These tools can show you such things as
error messages and events, services that have failed to start, and apps and devices hogging resources.
3. Search the web and ask coworkers. For Windows problems, search for the error message or description
of the problem on the web. When you perform a Google search, add site:microsoft.com to the end of the
search text to target your search to Microsoft websites. For problems with hardware and applications,
try searching the website of the manufacturer for support and help. Also, search the web on the error
message, application, or description of the problem. Look for forums where others have posted the
same problem with the same app or device. Someone else has likely posted a solution. However, be
careful and don’t take the advice unless you trust the website. After you’ve made a reasonable effort to
find help on your own, ask for help from coworkers who are more experienced.
Exam Tip
The common symptoms and problems listed in Table 14-2 are all on the A1 Core 2 exam. You need to know how to
recognize the symptom, use Windows tools and other methods to observe the problem, and then fix the problem.

Now let’s tackle each problem listed in Table 14-2.
Services Not Starting
Core 2 Objective 3.1
An error results when an application expects a background service to be running but it failed to start. Application
documentation should tell you whether the app relies on a service to work. For example, suppose a user tells you
that an app is not working; you verify that important data is backed up, and you research the web to discover that
this app is dependent on a service running in the background. You now have a theory of probable cause. Here are
the reasonable next steps to take:
● Step 1. Task Manager. Open Task Manager to find out what’s currently running. On the Processes tab, you
see the app is running, but the background process it requires is not running. You check the Services tab
and see that the status of this service is Stopped. To start the service, right-click it and click Start.
● Step 2. Services console. Now you need to figure out why the service was not running in the first place.
Open the Services console to make sure that the service is configured to start each time Windows starts.
● Step 3. Final reboot. Reboot the system to verify that the service and app are working as they should.
If problems persist, you might need to uninstall and reinstall the service or the application. Sometimes using
the Programs and Features window to repair the application will take care of the problem.
USB Controller Resource Warnings
Core 2 Objective 3.1
USB ports might fail or become unreliable because their drivers are corrupted or because Power Options are not
configured correctly. Do the following:
● Step 1. Device Manager. Check Device Manager for errors. Sometimes disabling or uninstalling a device
and then enabling or reinstalling it can fix a problem. You can also try updating the USB drivers from Device
Manager; however, a better option is to go to the motherboard manufacturer website and download and
install the latest chipset drivers on the motherboard, following directions on the website.
● Step 2. Power Options. Open Power Options in Control Panel, and disable USB selective suspend, as you
learned to do in the module “Maintaining Windows.” Sometimes lowering the power state of inactive USB
ports can make them unreliable.
● Steps 3 and 4. Test your theory and fix the problem. The rest of this module focuses on how to do that.
● Steps 5 and 6. Verify, prevent, and document. As you learned in the module “Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer Problems,” do one final reboot, and then verify with the user that all is working to their
satisfaction. Implement preventive measures as appropriate, and don’t forget to document your findings,
actions, and outcomes.
If you are troubleshooting a problem and make a change to the system, restart Windows and check to see if the problem
is resolved before you move on to the next fix.
Note 16
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know how to configure Power Options to solve a problem with USB controller
resource warnings.

Time Drift
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Time drift, also called clock drift, happens when a Windows system does not
report accurate time to time-sensitive
applications that require accuracy in milliseconds. When the CPU is operating consistently at high capacity (for example, in
real-time stock trading applications), it
might recognize a potential time drift and
then request the time from the hardware
clock on the motherboard. This clock, also
known as the Real Time Clock (RTC) or the
CMOS Clock, is not always accurate.
To prevent time drift, other methods
must be used to synchronize the Windows
clock. When Windows 10/11 is on a Windows domain, it can request the time via
the Windows Time Service (W32Time).
Microsoft claims W32Time provides accuracy within 1 millisecond under reasonable operating conditions and does so by
using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
Using NTP, the primary time server, which is said to be
working at Stratum 1 on the Windows domain, receives
its time from an external time source working at Stratum 0 (see Figure 14-33). This time source can be a GPS
or atomic device or a carrier service provided over the
Internet. Computers that receive their time from the
Stratum 1 server are at Stratum 2; computers at Stratum 3 receive their time from Stratum 2 servers. NTP
requires there be no more than 15 Stratum layers. The
higher the Stratum layer, the less accurate the time.
Microsoft recommends the workstation be no further
than Stratum 5 from the time source.
To set up a Windows workstation to use the
W32Time service, do the following:
1. Use the Services console to set the W32Time
service Startup type to Automatic. See
Figure 14-34.
2. Edit the registry to set values given you by the
network administrator, such as time intervals
to poll the time server and the number of
clock ticks to adjust for network latency (the
time it takes on the network for the time
server to send the time to the workstation).

Low Memory Warning
Core 2 Objective 3.1
You may get the Windows error message “Your computer is low on memory” because you do not have enough
memory to run the applications you are using, malware or another program is sucking up system resources, the
hard drive does not have enough free space to hold virtual memory, or you have too many apps and background
processes running. A good computer troubleshooter checks the simple things first. Do the following:
● Step 1. Task Manager. Open Task Manager and check the Processes tab to find out which programs are
using the most memory. Click the Memory column to sort by memory. Are there any memory-hungry apps
you can close? Are there background services you don’t need and can disable? Use Resource Monitor if you
need more details as to how memory is used.
● Step 2. Research the web. If you see a suspicious process, search the web on the process name. Is it malware? How to scan for malware is covered in the module “Security Strategies.” Does the web report that
a process hogs memory or has a memory leak (does not release its unused memory back to the system)?
Uninstall the program if you can do without it.
● Step 3. Low on resources. Windows uses both physical memory installed on the motherboard and virtual
memory stored in pagefile.sys on the hard drive. The problem might be not enough physical memory or
not enough virtual memory.
The Core 1 module “Supporting Processors and Upgrading Memory” covers how to use the Windows System Properties
dialog box to manage virtual memory on the hard drive.
Core to Core
● Step 4. System Information. Use System Information to find out how much physical memory is installed.
If you need to keep several apps open at the same time, you might need to add resources by upgrading
memory or adding a second hard drive to hold virtual memory.
● Step 5. Update chipset drivers. If this is a new installation of Windows, updating the motherboard chipset
drivers might help. It might be that the older drivers are not working well with Windows 10/11. Go to the
motherboard manufacturer website to download and install the drivers.
Sluggish Performance
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Sluggish Windows performance can be caused by a variety of issues including malware, low system resources, too
many programs and services running, and even a corrupted Windows installation. After you have interviewed the
user and backed up data, follow these steps:
● Step 1. Observe the system. Too many programs running can slow down a system. Use Task Manager and
Resource Monitor to help you identify programs that can be disabled or uninstalled, including programs
that are no longer needed, those that are hogging resources, and rogue programs that might be malware.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Step 2. Verify Windows updates and antivirus settings. Install the latest Windows updates, and verify the
system is scanning for malware. Updates might solve known problems with applications, while a system
scan can tell you if malware is at work.
● Step 3. Uninstall applications you no longer need, and optimize the hard drive. Uninstalling applications you no longer need should free up some space on the hard drive. Verify you have at least 15%–20%
free space on the drive and that the drive is automatically optimized as you learned to do in the module
“Maintaining Windows.”
● Step 4. Verify requirements for the OS and applications. The system might be slow because the OS
does not have the hardware resources it needs. Use System Information (msinfo32.exe) to find the model
and speed of the installed processor and hard drive as well as the amount of memory installed. Compare
all these values with the minimum and recommended requirements for Windows listed in the module
“Installing Windows” and for each frequently used application. If you suspect that the processor, hard
drive, or memory is a bottleneck, you can use Performance Monitor to get more information. If the bottleneck appears to be graphics, the problem might be solved by updating the graphics drivers or video
adapter. If you find that the system is slow because of a hardware component, discuss the situation with
the user.
● Step 5. Search for unnecessary startup programs you can eliminate. Open the Startup tab in Task Manager. In the list of startup items, look for a specific startup program you don’t want. If you’re not sure of the
purpose of a program, right-click it, and click Search online in the shortcut menu. Then search the web
for information on this program. Be careful to use only reliable sites for credible information.
Caution
A word of caution is important here: Many websites will tell you a legitimate process is malicious so you will download
and use their software to get rid of the process. However, their software is likely to be adware or spyware that you don’t
want. Make sure you can trust a site before you download from it or follow its advice.
The startup folder for all users is hidden by default. In the module “Maintaining Windows,” you learned how to “unhide”
folders that are hidden.
Note 17
● Step 6. Disable or uninstall startup items. If you want to find out whether disabling a startup entry gives
problems or improves performance, temporarily disable it using Task Manager. To permanently disable a
startup item, it’s best to uninstall the software or remove the entry from a startup folder. See the appendix
“Entry Points for Windows Startup Processes” for a list of startup folders.
● Step 7. Search for unwanted scheduled tasks. Open Task Scheduler and search through tasks to find those
you think are unnecessary or causing trouble. Research the software the task works with, and then decide
if you want to uninstall the software or disable the task. The best way to uninstall a scheduled task is to
uninstall the software that is responsible for the task.
For extremely slow systems that need a more drastic fix, set Windows for a clean boot. Then restart the system,
enable the programs you really need, and watch for errors. Enable just the services and programs you need.
Regardless of the method you use, be sure to restart the system after each change and note what happens. Do
you get an error message? Does a device or application no longer work? If so, you have probably disabled a service
or program you need.

Remember that you don’t want to permanently leave System Configuration or Task Manager in control of startup.
After you have used these tools to identify the problem, use other tools to permanently remove the problem service
or program from startup. Use the Services console to disable a service, use the Programs and Features window to
uninstall software, and remove program files from startup folders. After the problem is fixed, return System Configuration and/or Task Manager to a normal startup.
Don’t forget to restart the computer after making a change to verify that all is well.
System Instability
Core 2 Objective 3.1
When a Windows system is unstable, it can hang or give errors at any time or even shut down unexpectedly. The
problem can be caused by a virus, by corrupted data files, Windows system files, application software or device drivers, or by failing essential hardware devices. This part of the module covers what you can do to observe the system
and solve the problem after you have interviewed the user and backed up data. A great place to begin to form your
theory of probable cause is Event Viewer. And, as always, when you think the problem is solved, don’t forget to do
one last reboot to verify all is well and also complete your documentation.
Caution
You might be tempted to disable all Microsoft services. If you do, however, you will disable Networking, Event Logging,
Error Reporting, Windows Firewall, Windows Installer, Windows Backup, Print Spooler, Windows Update, System Protection, and other important services. These services should be disabled only when testing for performance problems and
then immediately enabled when the test is finished. Also, know that if you disable the Volume Shadow Copy service,
all restore points kept on the system will be lost. If you intend to use System Restore to fix a problem with the system,
don’t disable this service. If you are not sure what a service does, read its description in the Services console before
you change its status.
Event Viewer Solves a Mystery
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.3
Event Viewer can be useful in solving intermittent hardware problems. For example, I once worked in an office where
several people updated Microsoft Word documents stored on a file server. For weeks, people complained about
these Word documents getting corrupted. We downloaded the latest patches for Windows and Microsoft Office and
scanned for viruses, thinking that the problem might be with Windows or the application. Then we suspected that a
template file used to build the Word documents was corrupted. But nothing we did solved our problem of corrupted
Word documents. Finally one day someone thought to check Event Viewer on the file server. Event Viewer had faithfully been recording errors when writing to the hard drive. What we had suspected to be a software problem was in
fact a failing hard drive, which was full of bad sectors. We replaced the drive, and the problem went away. That day
I learned the value of checking Event Viewer very early in the troubleshooting process.
Applying Concepts
Has performance improved? If performance does not improve by disabling services or startup programs, go back
and enable them again. If a non-Microsoft service or startup program didn’t cause the problem, turn your attention
to Microsoft services or startup programs. Start disabling them one at a time.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Here are the general steps you can follow to observe the system and solve a problem with system instability
(we’ll discuss each step in more detail next):
● Step 1. Use Event Viewer to look for errors and warnings.
● Step 2. Update Windows and verify anti-malware settings.
● Step 3. Suspect a corrupted application or supporting service.
● Step 4. Suspect faulty memory.
● Step 5. Suspect a corrupted hard drive.
● Step 6. Suspect corrupted Windows system files.
● Step 7. Suspect corrupted device drivers.
● Step 8. Suspect corrupted third-party services or apps running in the background.
● Step 9. Suspect the Windows installation is corrupted.
Now let’s look at the details of each of these nine steps:
● Step 1. Use Event Viewer to look for errors and warnings. Recall that the Administrative Events log in Event
Viewer collects errors and warnings to help with problem solving. Investigate warning and error events that
might point to the source of the problem. A web search on the message can help.
● Step 2. Update Windows and verify anti-malware settings. Make sure Windows is updated, and other
Microsoft products are included in Windows updates. Eliminate malware by checking that anti-malware
settings are correct. If you find real-time protection is not on, do a full scan for malware.
● Step 3. Suspect a corrupted application or supporting service. If you observe that instability happens
when a particular application is running, try to repair the application. If that doesn’t work, uninstall and
reinstall the app.
● Step 4. Suspect faulty memory. Errors with memory are often difficult to diagnose because they can appear
intermittently and might be mistaken for application errors, user errors, or other hardware component
errors. With memory errors, the system may hang, a BSOD (blue screen of death) error might occur, or the
system may continue to function, with applications giving errors or data being corrupted. You can quickly
identify a problem with memory or eliminate memory as the source of a problem by using the Windows
Memory Diagnostics (mdsched.exe) tool.
Is Memory Failing?
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
The Memory Diagnostics (mdsched.exe) tool works before Windows is loaded to test memory for errors and can
be used on computers that don’t have Windows installed. Use one of these two methods to start the utility:
● Use the mdsched.exe command. After Windows has started, enter the mdsched.exe command. A
dialog box appears and asks if you want the tool to immediately restart the system and run the test, or
wait until the next restart.
● Boot from Windows setup media. If Windows is not the installed operating system or you cannot boot
from the hard drive, boot the computer from the Windows setup USB drive or DVD to test memory for
errors. Follow these steps:
1. If necessary, change the boot priority order in BIOS/UEFI setup to boot first from the optical drive or USB
drive. Boot from the Windows setup DVD or USB drive.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Step 5. Suspect a corrupted hard drive. To eliminate the hard drive as the source of an unstable system,
run the chkdsk c: /r command to check the drive. The error-checking utility searches for bad sectors
on a volume and recovers the data from them if possible. It then marks the sector as bad so it will not be
reused. Also check Event Viewer for warnings or errors regarding the hard drive.
● Step 6. Suspect corrupted Windows system files. Use the System File Checker (SFC) to scan for corrupted or
missing system files, and replace them with a fresh copy. Enter the sfc /scannow command in an elevated
command prompt window. If you still have problems, use System Configuration to perform a Safe boot. In
Safe Mode, enter the sfc /scannow command. If that doesn’t solve the problem, try System Restore.
● Step 7. Suspect corrupted device drivers. Check Device Manager for errors. If a device shows a problem
that has recently been updated, roll back driver updates. Try updating drivers. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the device.
● Step 8. Suspect corrupted third-party services or apps running in the background. Follow the steps given
next to perform a clean boot.
Perform a Clean Boot
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
Here’s how to perform a clean boot to disable all third-party software during Windows startup:
1. To open System Configuration, enter the msconfig.exe command. The System Configuration box is
shown earlier in Figure 14-24 with the General tab selected.
2. Click the Services tab and check Hide all Microsoft services. The list now shows only services put there
by third-party software (refer back to Figure 14-25). Click Disable all.
3. Click the General tab and notice that Selective startup is now selected. Click Apply and close the System
Configuration box.
4. Open Task Manager and select the Startup tab (refer back to Figure 14-17). For each startup item, select
it and click Disable. Close the Task Manager window and restart Windows.
Verify that the problem is solved in a clean boot environment. If the problem is solved, keep enabling several
startup programs and rebooting until you zero in on the offending startup service or app.
After you have uninstalled the problem program or eliminated startup programs as the source of the problem,
be sure to do the following to return to a normal Windows startup:
1. Open the System Configuration box. On the General tab, click Normal startup. On the Services tab,
uncheck Hide all Microsoft services. Verify that all services are now checked.
2. Open Task Manager. In the Task Manager window, select each startup item and enable it. Close all
windows and restart the system.
Applying Concepts
Caution
Don’t depend on System Configuration or Task Manager to be a permanent fix to disable a startup program
or service. Once you’ve decided you want to make the change permanent, use other methods to permanently
remove that process from Windows startup. For example, you might uninstall a program, remove it from a
startup folder, or use the Services console to disable a service.

● Step 9. Suspect the Windows installation is corrupted. By now in the troubleshooting process, you have
eliminated memory, the hard drive, Windows system files, malware, and third-party services and programs
as the likely source of system instability. It’s time to consider the entire Windows installation might be
corrupted. Recall from the module “Installing Windows” that you can repair Windows 10/11 by performing
an in-place upgrade. Follow directions given in that module to download and upgrade the Windows 10/11
installation. If the problem is still not solved, consider whether the CPU or motherboard is failing.
How to troubleshoot a failing motherboard or CPU is covered in the Core 1 module “Power Supplies and Troubleshooting Computer Problems” and is content on the A1 Core 1 exam.
Core to Core
Application Errors and Crashes
Core 2 Objective 3.1
For application errors and crashes—as you do for any computer problem—begin by interviewing the user, backing
up important data, examining the system, investigating the problem, and establishing a theory of probable cause.
For application crashes, consider and do these things:
● Step 1. End a hung application. If an application refuses to close, recall you can use Task Manager to end
the application. If the app still refuses to close, do the following:
1. On the Details tab of Task Manager, note the process identifier (PID) of the process—for example, 7132.
2. In a command prompt window, enter the command taskkill /f /pid:7132, substituting the PID
you noted in Step 1. The /f parameter forcefully kills the process. Be careful when using this command;
it is so powerful that you can end critical system processes that will cause the system to shut down.
● Step 2. Search the web on error messages and symptoms. Suppose the error message in Figure 14-37
appears when a user clicks a link in an Outlook email message. A quick web search shows the problem is
that the Microsoft browser is not the Windows default browser. Changing the default browser quickly solves
the problem.
Figure 14-37 Search the web on an error message or symptom to find an explanation and solution
● Step 3. Consider data corruption. For applications such as Microsoft 365 that use data files, it might appear
that the application, Windows, or hardware has a problem when the problem is really a corrupted data file.
Try creating an entirely new data file. If that works, then suspect that previous errors might be caused by
corrupted data.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Step 4. Check application settings and logs for errors. Maybe a user has made one too many changes to
the application settings, which can cause a problem with missing toolbars and other functions. Write down
each setting the user has changed, and then restore all settings back to their default values. If the problem is solved, restore each setting to the way the user had it until you find the one causing the problem.
The process will take some time, but users can get upset if you change their application settings without
justification.
● Step 5. Repair or update the application. The application setup might have the option to repair the installation. Look for it in the Programs and Features window or on the manufacturer’s website. If Windows update
settings allow it, Microsoft apps are updated along with Windows updates.
Caution
When researching a problem on the web, you might discover that Microsoft or a manufacturer offers a fix or patch you
can download and apply. To get the right patch, recall you need to make sure you get a 32-bit patch for a 32-bit installation of Windows, a device driver, or an application. For a 64-bit installation of Windows, make sure you get a 64-bit
device driver. An application installed in a 64-bit OS might be a 32-bit application or a 64-bit application.
● Step 6. Uninstall and reinstall the application. Do so with caution because you might lose any customized
settings, macros, or scripts. Also know this still might not solve a problem with a corrupted application
because registry entries might not be properly reset during the uninstall process.
Here are other errors that might occur with applications and what to do about them:
● If a data file fails to open, change the default program for the file type. Windows depends on the file
extension to associate a data file with an application used to open it; this is called the file association. An
application associated with a file extension is called its default program. To change a file association, rightclick the file in Explorer and click Open with, click Choose another app, check Always use this app to open
files, and then find and select the new application.
● If an application has never worked or stops working after the OS has been upgraded, follow these steps:
1. Update Windows and search the web. Installing all Windows updates can sometimes solve a
problem with an application that won’t install. Also check the website of the software manufacturer
and the Microsoft support site (support.microsoft.com) for solutions. Search on the application name
or the error message you get when you try to run it. Verify that the application is approved by its
manufacturer to work in the installed OS.
2. Run the installation program or application as an administrator. The program might require that
the user have privileges not assigned to the current user account. Try running the application
with administrator privileges, which Windows calls a secondary logon. Use Explorer to locate the
executable program file in a subfolder of the Program Files or Program Files (x86) folder. Right-click the
file and select Run as administrator from the shortcut menu (see Figure 14-38).
You might be able to recover part of a corrupted file by changing its file extension to .txt and importing it into the
application as a text file.

4. Verify there is not a conflict or compatibility issue. To eliminate these conflicts, run the application
causing problems after a clean boot. If a clean boot allows the application to run without errors, you
need to methodically zero in on the third-party program until you discover the one in conflict.
Module Summary
Windows Under the Hood
● The Windows OS is made up of two main components: the shell and the kernel. The shell provides an interface for users and applications. The kernel is responsible for interacting with hardware.
● A process is a program running under the shell, together with all the resources assigned to it. A thread is a
single task that a process requests from the kernel.
Survey of Windows Tools and Techniques for Troubleshooting
● Windows tools that conveniently access and manage other Windows tools are Control Panel, Administrative
Tools in Windows 10 or Windows Tools in Windows 11, Computer Management, and Microsoft Management
Console (MMC).
Figure 14-40 This program is digitally signed
3. Verify that the application is digitally signed. Although applications that are not digitally signed can
still run on Windows, a digital signature does verify that the application is not a rogue application
and that it is certified as Windows-compatible by Microsoft. To view the digital signature, select the
Digital Signatures tab of the program file’s Properties box. Select a signer in the list, and click Details
(see Figure 14-40). If the Digital Signatures tab is missing, the program is not digitally signed.

Troubleshooting Windows Problems
● Problems related to Windows and its applications include services not starting, USB controller resource
warnings, time drift, low memory warnings, sluggish performance, system instability, and applications
crashing.
● For all computer problems, follow a six-step solution: (1) identify the problem by asking the user to explain
what happened and show you the problem; (2) establish your theory of probable cause; (3) test your theory;
(4) fix the problem; (5) verify the solution and, if possible, prevent the problem from happening again; and
(6) document your findings, actions, and outcomes.
● When solving Windows-related problems, be sure to interview the user, back up data, and get help from
error messages, the web, coworkers, and event logs. Also, consider that the data or the application might
be corrupted; consider outside interference such as malware, faulty memory, a corrupted hard drive, low
system resources, and incompatible applications or third-party services; and consider that Windows might
be corrupted.
● Tasks that might be involved when troubleshooting Windows problems include rebooting; restarting a
service; uninstalling, reinstalling, and updating an application; adding resources; verifying requirements;
performing a system file check; and repairing Windows.
● A clean boot or booting into Safe Mode can help eliminate applications, services, and device drivers that
might contribute to Windows problems.
● On a Windows domain, a time server can be accessed using NTP and the Windows Time Service (W32Time).
● In Explorer, use the shortcut menu for a data file to create a file association so Windows knows which application is associated with the given data file. This can solve the problem of a file that fails to open.

Thinking Critically
These questions are designed to prepare you for the critical thinking required for the A1 exams and may use
information from other modules and the web.
1. A user complains that their computer is performing slowly. They tell you the problem started about a week
ago when new database software was installed. The software runs in the background to update a database
synced between the user’s workstation and the database server. Which is the best tool or method to use to

Editing and Restoring the Registry
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.3
When you install Windows on a new computer, Windows setup gives you the opportunity to enter the computer’s
registered owner and registered organization. Practice editing and restoring the registry by doing the following to
change the registered owner name:
1. Enter the command winver.exe, which displays the About Windows box. Who is the registered owner
and registered organization of the computer? If asked to do so by your instructor, take a screenshot of the
About Windows box showing the registered owner.
2. Using the Registry Editor, export the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion to an export file stored on the desktop.
Hands-On Project 14-4
Using Event Viewer
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.3
Event Viewer can be intimidating to use, but it is really nothing more than a bunch of logs you can search and
manipulate. If you have Microsoft 365 installed, open a Word document, make some changes in it, and close it
without saving your changes. Now open Event Viewer and look in Applications and Services Logs and Microsoft
Office Alerts. What event is recorded about your actions?

Using DISM to Repair Windows
Est. Time: 45 minutes excluding download time
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
The DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) commands are used to create, manage, and deploy
standard system images. When SFC cannot fix a problem with a corrupted Windows 10/11 installation, you can use
DISM commands to repair system files.
You’ll need a standard image. If you don’t have one, you can extract one from the Windows setup files:
1. If you don’t have a copy of the Windows setup ISO file from the Microsoft website, follow directions in the
module “Installing Windows” to download the ISO file.
2. In Explorer, right-click the ISO file, and click Mount. The ISO file is mounted and assigned a drive letter. You
can now drill down into the file.
3. Copy the install.esd file in the \sources folder of the ISO drive to the root of drive C:.
4. Run this command to examine the install.esd file and to see the images in it:
dism /get-wiminfo /wimfile:C:\install.esd
What is the index number for Windows 10/11 Pro? In our example in Figure 14-42, the number for
Windows 10 Pro is 6.

Introduction
Most techies use the terms “boot” and “startup” interchangeably. However, in general, the term “boot” refers to the
hardware phase of starting up a computer. Microsoft consistently uses the term “startup” to refer to how its operating
systems are booted—I mean, started.
Note 1
Different Ways to Boot
Core 2 Objective 3.1
The term booting comes from the phrase “lifting yourself up by your bootstraps” and refers to the computer bringing itself up to a working state without the user having to do anything but press the On button. There are two fundamental ways to boot a computer:
●● A hard boot, or cold boot, involves turning on the power with the on/off switch.
●● A soft boot, or warm boot, involves using the operating system to reboot. In Windows, a soft boot is called
a restart.
A hard boot takes more time than a soft boot because a hard boot requires the initial steps performed by
BIOS/UEFI. Most desktop cases have three power buttons; an example of these buttons on one system is shown in
Figure 15-1.
Here’s how the buttons work:
●● The power button in front can be configured as a “soft” power button, causing a Windows restart.
●● The reset button initializes the CPU so it restarts at the beginning of the BIOS/UEFI startup program.
The computer behaves as though the power were turned off and back on and then goes through the entire
boot process.
●● The switch on the rear of the case simply turns off the power abruptly and is a “hard” power button. If
you use this switch, wait 30 seconds before you press the power button on the front of the case to boot
the system. This method gives you the greatest assurance that memory will clear. However, if Windows is
abruptly stopped, it might give an error message when you reboot.
You’ve already learned how to deal with application and hardware problems, and Windows problems after the OS
has started. In this module, you take your troubleshooting skills one step further by learning to deal with startup
problems caused by Windows. When Windows fails to start, it can be stressful if important data has not been backed
up or the user has pressing work to do with the computer. What helps more than anything else is to have a good
understanding of Windows startup and a good plan for approaching startup problems.
We begin the module with a discussion of what happens when you first turn on a computer and Windows starts.
The more you understand about startup, the better your chances of fixing startup problems. Then you learn about
Windows tools specifically designed to handle startup problems. Finally, you learn about strategies for solving
startup problems. As you work, note that the troubleshooting tools and skills for Windows 10 work the same way as
for Windows 11, with only a few minor changes in menu options.
Understanding the Boot Process
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Knowledge is power. The better you understand what happens when you first turn on a computer until Windows is
loaded and the Windows desktop appears, the more likely you will be able to solve a problem when Windows cannot
start. Let’s begin by noting the differences between a hard boot and a soft boot.

Component or File Partition and Path* Description
BIOS systems using MBR partitioning
MBR The first sector of the hard
drive is called the Master
Boot Record (MBR)
BIOS looks to the partition table in the MBR to locate
the active partition.
System partition Also called the active
partition or System
Reserved partition
The system partition holds the Boot Manager, Boot
Configuration Data (BCD) store, and other files and
folders needed to begin Windows startup. For Windows,
these files are stored in the root and \Boot directory of
the hidden system partition.
Boot Manager In the root of the system
partition
Windows Boot Manager, bootmgr (with no file
extension), accesses the BCD store and locates the
Windows Boot Loader.
Table 15-1 Software components and files needed to start Windows
How the front two buttons work can be controlled in BIOS/UEFI setup. Know, however, that different cases offer
different options.
When Windows hangs, first try a restart. If that doesn’t work, try a shutdown and then power the system back
up. A Windows shutdown closes all open applications, user sessions, services, devices, and system processes and
then powers down the computer. If a shutdown does not work, press the reset button on the front of the case. If that
doesn’t work, turn off the power switch on the rear of the case, wait 30 seconds, turn it back on, and then press the
power button on the front of the case.
Steps to Boot the Computer and Start Windows
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Recall that BIOS/UEFI is responsible for getting a system up and going and finding an OS to load. Table 15-1 lists the
components and files stored on the hard drive that are necessary to start Windows. The table can serve as a guide
as you study the steps to see what happens from the time power is turned on until Windows is started. In these
steps, we assume the OS is loaded from the hard drive.

Component or File Partition and Path* Description
BCD store \Boot directory on the
system partition
The Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store is a
database file named BCD (no file extension), and it is
organized the same as a registry hive. It contains boot
settings that control the Boot Manager and can be
viewed and edited with the bcdedit command.
UEFI systems using GPT partitioning
GPT partition table At the beginning of the
hard drive, with a backup
copy at the end of the
drive
UEFI looks to the GPT partition table to locate the EFI
System Partition.
System partition The EFI System Partition
(ESP) is normally 100 MB
to 200 MB in size.
The system partition holds the Windows Boot
Manager, BCD, and other supporting files. For
Windows, the Boot Manager is Bootmgfw.efi and
is stored in \EFI\Microsoft\Boot. A backup copy of
Bootmgfw.efi is at \EFI\Boot\bootx64.efi.
Boot Manager For Windows, \EFI\
Microsoft\ Boot on
the ESP
Bootmgfw.efi loads EFI applications based on variables
stored in onboard RAM and reads the BCD store to find
out other boot parameters (such as a dual boot).
BCD store \EFI\Microsoft\Boot on
the ESP
Entries in the BCD store point the Windows Boot
Manager to the location of the Windows Boot Loader
program.
All Windows BIOS and UEFI systems
Windows Boot Loader C:\Windows\System32* Windows Boot Manager turns control over to the
Windows Boot Loader, which loads and starts essential
Windows processes. Two versions of the program file
are Winload.exe (BIOS) and Winload.efi (UEFI).
Resume from hibernation C:\Windows\System32 Windows Boot Loader runs when Windows resumes
from hibernation. Two versions of the program are
Winresume.exe for BIOS and Winresume.efi for UEFI.

Study these steps carefully because the better you understand startup, the more likely you’ll be able to solve
startup problems:
1. Startup BIOS/UEFI is responsible for the early steps in the boot process. Onboard RAM accessible to
BIOS/UEFI holds an inventory of hardware devices, hardware settings, security passwords, date and
time, and startup settings. Startup BIOS/UEFI reads this information and then surveys the hardware
devices it finds present, comparing it with the list kept in its RAM.
2. Startup BIOS/UEFI runs POST (power-on self-test), which is a series of tests to find out if the firmware
can communicate correctly with essential hardware components required for a successful boot. Any
errors are indicated as a series of beeps, recorded speech, or error messages on the screen (after video
is checked). If the key is pressed to request BIOS/UEFI setup, the BIOS/UEFI setup program runs.

2. Starts Csrss.exe (subsystem that interacts with apps)
3. Starts Logon Manager (Winlogon.exe)
4. Reads and executes other components stored in registry
1. Starts Service Control Manager (Services.exe)
Starts services set with type = Automatic
2. Starts the Local Security Authority process (Lsass.exe)
Applies Group Policy settings and loads any program stored in
registry keys and folders (if not prevented by Group Policy)
3. Launches Userinit.exe
Logon screen is displayed; user account and
password passed to Lsass for authenticating
OS kernel
Onboard RAM, also called onboard memory, nonvolatile RAM, or NVRAM, is used by BIOS/UEFI to hold configuration
data. Onboard RAM, which keeps its data even when power is turned off, is different from system memory or RAM,
which holds programs and data only while the system is turned on.

3. Based on information kept in onboard RAM, startup UEFI loads the UEFI boot manager and device
drivers. BIOS/UEFI then turns to the hard drive or other boot device to locate and launch the Windows
Boot Manager. If BIOS/UEFI cannot find a Windows Boot Manager or cannot turn over operation to it, one
of these error messages appears:
Missing operating system
No OS found
Error loading operating system
Windows failed to load
Invalid partition table
4. The Windows Boot Manager does the following:
a. It reads the settings in the BCD.
b. The next step depends on entries in the BCD and these other factors:
●● Option 1. For normal startups that are not dual booting, no menu appears, and Boot Manager finds
and launches the Windows Boot Loader program.
●● Option 2. If the computer is set up for a dual-boot environment, Boot Manager displays the
message, Choose an operating system screen, as shown in Figure 15-4.
Figure 15-4 In a dual-boot setup, Windows Boot Manager provides a
choice of operating systems
●● Option 3. If Windows was previously stopped abruptly or another error occurs, the Windows
Startup Menu appears (see Figure 15-5) to give you the option to troubleshoot the problem.

5. Windows Boot Loader (Winload.exe or Winload.efi) is responsible for loading Windows components.
It does the following:
a. For normal startups, Boot Loader loads into system memory the OS kernel, Ntoskrnl.exe, but does
not yet start it. Boot Loader also loads into memory the hardware abstraction layer (Hal.dll), which
will later be used by the kernel.
b. Boot Loader loads into memory the system registry hive (C:\Windows\System32\Config\System).
c. Boot Loader then reads the registry key just created, HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\SYSTEM\Services,
looking for and loading into memory the device drivers that must be launched at startup. The drivers
are not yet started.
d. Boot Loader starts up the memory paging process and then turns over startup to the OS kernel
(Ntoskrnl.exe).
6. The kernel (Ntoskrnl.exe) does the following:
a. It activates the HAL, reads more information from the registry, and builds into memory the registry key
HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\HARDWARE, using information about the hardware that has been collected.
b. The kernel then starts critical services and drivers that are configured to be started by the kernel
during the boot. Recall that drivers interact directly with hardware and run in kernel mode, whereas
services interact with drivers. Most services and drivers are stored in C:\Windows\System32 or
C:\Windows\System32\Drivers and have an .exe, .dll, or .sys file extension.
After the kernel starts all services and drivers configured to load during the boot, it starts the
Session Manager (Smss.exe), which runs in user mode.
7. The Session Manager (Smss.exe) loads the graphical interface and starts the client/server run-time
subsystem (Csrss.exe), which also runs in user mode. Csrss.exe is the Win32 subsystem component that
interacts with applications.
8. Smss.exe starts the Logon Manager (Winlogon.exe) and reads and executes other commands stored in
the registry, such as a command to replace system files placed there by Windows Update.
9. Winlogon.exe does the following:
a. It starts the Service Control Manager (Services.exe), which starts all services listed with the startup
type of Automatic in the Services console.
b. Winlogon.exe starts the Local Security Authority process (Lsass.exe). The sign-in screen appears
(see Figure 15-6), and the user account and password are passed to the Lsass.exe process for
authenticating.
c. Winlogon.exe launches Userinit.exe. The Windows desktop is launched.

Processes” for a list of these folders and registry keys.
The Windows startup is officially completed when the Windows desktop appears and the pinwheel wait icon
disappears.
With this basic knowledge of the boot in hand, let’s turn our attention to what you can do to prepare for problems when Windows refuses to load.
What to Do before a Problem Occurs
Core 2 Objective 3.1
When troubleshooting startup, it helps to have a road map, which is the purpose of the diagram in Figure 15-7. It
can help you organize in your mind the various ways to boot the system and the menus and procedures available
to you depending on how the boot happens.

As you learn to use each tool, keep in mind that you want to use the tool that makes as few changes to the
system as possible to fix the problem. Good preparation will make troubleshooting startup problems much simpler
and more successful. When you are responsible for a computer and while the computer is still healthy, be sure to
complete the following tasks:
●● Keep good backups. The module “Maintaining Windows” covers methods to back up data, applications,
and user settings.
●● Turn on System Restore. Recall from the module “Maintaining Windows” that by default System Restore is
turned off. Use the System Properties dialog box to turn it on.
●● Create a system image. Recall from the module “Maintaining Windows” that a system image can be created
right after you’ve installed Windows, hardware, applications, and user accounts and customized Windows
settings. The image can be updated periodically.
●● Configure Windows to use the F8 key at startup. The F8 key gives you access to the Advanced Boot Options
menu in Windows, which you’ll learn about later in this module. Windows 10/11 has the feature disabled by
default. To enable the F8 key at startup, open an elevated command prompt window, and enter this command:
bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy
Figure 15-8 shows the Advanced Boot Options screen that appears when you press F8 during Windows 11
startup.

Caution
As you learn to troubleshoot Windows startup, don’t depend on the F8 key to work during the boot, because you never
know when you’ll work on a computer that has it disabled. All the tools available on the Advanced Boot Options screen
are also available on the Windows 10 Startup Settings screen, which you can access without using F8. You learn about
the Startup Settings screen later in this module. For Windows 11, you also learn how to access the Advanced Boot
Options screen without using F8.
Later, if you want to disable the use of F8 at startup, open an elevated command prompt window, and enter
this command:
bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy standard
Figure 15-8 Use the Advanced Boot Options menu to troubleshoot difficult startup
problems
●● Create recovery boot media. If Windows can’t boot from the hard drive, you may be able to repair the
Windows installation using tools available in the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE or WinRE).
Windows RE is normally stored on a hidden partition on the hard drive and is a lean operating system
that can be launched to solve Windows startup problems. It provides both a graphical and command-line
interface. The diagram shown earlier in Figure 15-7 shows Windows RE as a gray background. In that figure,
menus in Windows RE are in green, tools are in blue and orange, and ways to launch Windows RE are in yellow boxes. Notice in Figure 15-7 that you can launch Windows RE after a normal Windows startup. However,
if Windows won’t start, you’ll need other recovery boot media to launch it. Although it’s possible to use
recovery media created on a different computer than the one you are troubleshooting, the process is simplified if you already have these tools on hand. Figure 15-7 shows the three types of recovery boot media:
■ Windows 10/11 DVD system repair disc
■ Windows 10/11 USB recovery drive
■ Windows 10/11 setup media, which was created earlier by the Media Creation Tool

Windows 10/11 System Repair Disc
Core 2 Objective 3.1
A system repair disc is a bootable DVD with Windows repair tools that can start the system and fix problems. Using
the DVD requires an optical drive. Open Control Panel and go to the Backup and Restore (Windows 7) window
(see Figure 15-9). Click Create a system repair disc. A 32-bit Windows installation will create a 32-bit version of the
repair disc, and a 64-bit Windows installation will create a 64-bit version of the repair disc. To use a system repair
disc, boot the system from the disc, and select your keyboard layout. Then Windows RE is launched.
Figure 15-9 Create a system image or a system repair disc from Control Panel
A recovery drive is bit-specific: Use a 32-bit recovery drive to repair a 32-bit Windows installation and a 64-bit recovery
drive to repair a 64-bit installation.
Note 4
Windows 10/11 Recovery Drive
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Suppose the hard drive in a laptop completely fails. You can purchase a new hard drive for the system, but a problem
might arise when you install Windows on the new drive. Most laptops, all-in-one, and other brand-name computers
include an OEM recovery partition on the hard drive that contains a copy of the OS build, device drivers, diagnostics
programs, and preinstalled applications needed to restore the system to its factory state. Before a problem occurs,
you can back up this OEM recovery partition to a Windows recovery drive. A recovery drive is a bootable USB flash
drive that can access Windows repair tools; in addition to holding an OEM recovery partition, it is handy when you
need to repair a computer that doesn’t have an optical drive.
All boot media are bit-specific. Use 32-bit media to repair a 32-bit Windows installation and 64-bit media to repair
a 64-bit installation.
Note 3
The key to using a system repair disc or recovery drive is to create the disc or drive before it is needed. Let’s
look at each of the three recovery boot media.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
If you include the system files on the recovery drive, you have the option of reinstalling Windows from the recovery drive. As you can see in Figure 15-7, a recovery drive can be used to perform a Windows 10/11 reset, which you
learn about later in the module. You can use a recovery drive to repair a computer other than the one on which it
was created. However, system files included on a recovery drive may not be compatible with all computers.
Do the following to create a recovery drive:
1. Open Control Panel in Classic view, and click Recovery. Click Create a recovery drive, and respond to
the UAC dialog box.
2. Choose whether to include system files (see Figure 15-10), which will copy the OEM recovery partition
to the recovery drive. If the computer doesn’t have an OEM recovery partition, the check box on this
dialog box is gray and not available. Click Next to continue.
Figure 15-10 Back up system files to the recovery drive so you can reinstall Windows later
3. Windows reports the size of the USB flash drive needed (see Figure 15-11). Plug in a USB flash drive that
is large enough. Know that the entire USB flash drive will be formatted, and everything on the drive will
be lost.

If you copied the OEM recovery partition to the USB flash drive and are short on hard drive space on the computer,
you can use Disk Management to delete the recovery partition and free up some space, and then expand the Windows
volume.

4. Windows inspects the size of the drive; if it is large enough, you see it listed among available devices. Be
careful to select the USB flash drive because everything on the drive will be lost. Click Next. Click Create
to begin the process. It will take a while to complete. Then click Finish.
Be sure to label the flash drive well, and put it in a safe place. For example, you can put it in an envelope, label
it “Recovery drive for John Hawkins 64-bit Windows 10 Sony laptop,” and store it in the computer’s documentation file.

Windows 10/11 Media Creation Tool
Core 2 Objective 3.1
You can launch Windows RE from a Windows setup DVD or flash drive. For Windows 10/11, recall you can use the
Media Creation Tool on a working computer to create a bootable Windows setup ISO file, DVD, or flash drive. You
learned how to use the Media Creation Tool in the module “Installing Windows.”
Tools for Solving Windows
Startup Problems
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Looking back at the diagram in Figure 15-7, note that tools to diagnose and repair Windows are shown in orange
boxes. In this part of the module, we discuss how these tools can help you solve a startup problem. The tools are
covered beginning with the least-invasive ones.
If Windows works well enough to get to the Windows desktop, you can use one of the following methods to
launch Windows RE:
●● Windows 10/11 Settings app. Open the Settings app and, for Windows 10, click Update & Security. For Windows
11, click System. In the left pane, click Recovery. Under Advanced startup, click Restart now. See Figure 15-12.

The Advanced startup option is not available on the Recovery window when you are using a remote connection to the
computer or when Windows 10/11 is installed in a VM. To force a VM into the recovery environment, in a command
prompt window, run the command reagentc /boottore, and then restart the VM.
Note 6
You can also use the shutdown command to remotely shut down computers over the network.
Note 7
●● Shift1Restart. From the Windows Start menu, click the Power icon. Press and hold the Shift key, and click
Restart.
●● Command prompt. In a command prompt window, enter shutdown /r /o. The /r parameter instructs
the computer to restart, and the /o parameter opens Windows RE after the restart.
Figure 15-13 Windows automatically launches diagnostic and
repair procedures after several restarts within
a few minutes
Here are the methods to launch Windows RE when Windows cannot start normally:
●● Windows detects startup problems and launches automatic diagnostics and repairs. If you restart the
computer several times within a few minutes or if Windows detects errors during startup, it automatically
launches diagnostics (see Figure 15-13) and takes you through steps to attempt to repair the system. The
process, called Automatic Repair or Startup Repair, includes running both Check Disk and System File
Checker.
If Automatic Repair fails, you’re given the option to boot into Windows RE, where you have access to other
troubleshooting tools.

When you are trying to restart a computer while troubleshooting it yourself, you might find that Automatic Repair
slows down or interferes with your efforts. In this case, you can disable Automatic Repair as follows: Open an elevated
command prompt window, enter bcdedit /set recoveryenabled no, and then perform your own repair
steps. You can re-enable Automatic Repair later with the command bcdedit /set recoveryenabled yes.
Note 8
●● From the sign-in screen. If you can get to the sign-in screen, press and hold the Shift key as you click Power
and then Restart. Windows RE launches. (This method also works in most VMs.)
●● Reboot Windows several times. Each time you see the Windows screen appear, turn off power to the computer, wait 10 seconds, and press the power button to turn on the computer. After you do this several times,
turn on the computer, and Automatic Repair should launch followed by Windows RE.
●● Boot from a USB recovery drive, DVD system repair disc, or Windows setup DVD or USB drive. These
boot recovery media give you the option to launch Windows RE. You might have to adjust BIOS/UEFI settings to boot from these alternate media. To launch Windows RE from a Windows setup DVD or flash drive,
click Repair your computer when you see the Windows Setup screen.
●● Press F8 during startup. Earlier in the module, you learned how to configure Windows to enable F8 at
startup. If it is enabled, press F8 during startup to launch the Advanced Boot Options menu (refer back to
Figure 15-8), which is part of Windows RE.
Exploring Windows RE Menus and Options
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
Let’s explore the menu screens in Windows RE, which are shown in green boxes in Figure 15-7. Follow these steps
to explore Windows RE menus:
1. Start Windows and use one of the methods listed earlier to launch Windows RE. The first screen you
see after Windows RE launches is the Windows Startup Menu or the Choose an option screen (see
Figure 15-14) for Windows 11. The Use a device option on the menu is new to Windows 11 and is used to
recover a system from a network deployment server or other media.

Next, we discuss some tools to repair Windows, including Startup Repair, Startup Settings, System Restore,
uninstalling updates, and commands entered in a command prompt window.
Startup Repair
Core 2 Objective 3.1
When addressing startup problems, the first tool to try is Startup Repair, which is a built-in diagnostic and repair
tool. It can fix Windows system files without changing Windows settings, user data, or applications. You can’t cause
additional problems with the tool, and it’s easy to use.
To run Startup Repair in Windows RE, drill down to the Advanced options screen (refer back to Figure 15-16) and
click Startup Repair. Windows RE examines the system, fixes problems, reports what it did, and might offer suggestions for further fixes. A log file of the process can be found at C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\SRT\SRTTrail.txt.
Changing Startup Settings
Core 2 Objective 3.1
The Startup Settings option on the Advanced options screen shown in Figure 15-16 is available only when Windows RE
is launched from the hard drive rather than other media. Following directions given earlier, launch Windows RE and
drill down to the Windows 10 Startup Settings screen shown earlier, in Figure 15-18 or the Windows 11 Advanced Boot
Options screen shown earlier in Figure 15-8. Here’s a quick rundown of what these tools can do.
Press 1 or F1: Enable Debugging
This tool moves system boot logs from the failing computer to another computer for evaluation. The computers
must be connected by way of a serial port. For Windows 11, the option is Debugging Mode.
Press 2 or F2: Enable Boot Logging
Windows loads normally and all files used during the load process are recorded in a log file, C:\Windows\ntbtlog.
txt (see Figure 15-19). Use this option to see what did and did not load during the boot. For instance, if you have a
problem getting a device to work, check Ntbtlog.txt to see what driver files loaded. Boot logging is much more effective if you have a copy of Ntbtlog.txt that was made when everything worked as it should. Then you can compare
the good load with the bad load, looking for differences.
The Ntbtlog.txt file is also generated when you boot into Safe Mode.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
If Windows hangs during the boot, try booting using the Enable Boot Logging option. Then look at the last entry in the
Ntbtlog.txt file. This entry might be the name of a device driver causing the system to hang.
Note 11
Other tasks you can try in Safe Mode include the following:
●● Update Windows.
●● Launch anti-malware software to scan the system for malware.
●● Open Event Viewer to find events that are helpful in troubleshooting the system.
●● Run the System File Checker command (sfc /scannow) to restore system files.
●● Use Device Manager to roll back a driver.
●● Use Memory Diagnostics (mdsched.exe) to verify memory.
●● Use the chkdsk /r command to check for file system errors.
●● Configure Windows for a clean boot on the next restart.
Recall from the module “Troubleshooting Windows After Startup” that you can also launch Safe Mode from the
Boot tab on the System Configuration window, where Safe Mode is called Safe boot.
Press 3 or F3: Enable Low-Resolution Video (640 × 480)
Use this option when the video settings don’t allow you to see the screen well enough to fix a bad setting (for example,
black fonts on a black background or a corrupted video driver). Booting in this mode gives you a very plain, standard
video in VGA mode. You can then go to Display settings, correct the problem, and reboot normally. For problems
with video drivers, open Device Manager, and update, roll back, or uninstall and reinstall the video drivers.
Press 4 or F4: Enable Safe Mode
With this option, the Safe Mode desktop appears (see Figure 15-20) after the system restarts and you sign in to
Windows. Launching Safe Mode and then restarting the system again can sometimes solve a startup problem.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Press 5 or F5: Enable Safe Mode With Networking
Use this option when you need access to the network to solve the problem. For example, you might need to download
updates to your anti-malware software. Also use this mode when the Windows installation files are available on the
network, rather than Windows setup media, and you need to access those files.
Press 6 or F6: Enable Safe Mode With Command Prompt
If Safe Mode can’t start, try Safe Mode with Command Prompt, which doesn’t attempt to load the graphical
interface. At the command prompt, use the sfc /scannow command to verify system files (see Figure 15-21). If
the problem is still not solved,
you can use the rstrui command
to launch System Restore and
then follow the on-screen directions to select a restore point.
However, as Figure 15-22 shows,
if restore points have not been
previously made, System Restore
cannot help. As you learn later
in the module, you can also use
this command prompt to restore
a corrupted Windows registry
from backups.

The A1 Core 2 exam gives you a scenario and expects you to know when and how to use Safe Mode to help resolve a
Windows startup problem.

Suppose a recent Windows update that includes device driver updates has caused the system to hang. When you try
to fix the problem by applying a restore point, the system hangs again. The problem is caused by device drivers in
conflict. To fix the problem, you can disable driver signature enforcement, undo system restore, and apply the restore
point again. This time, it should work.
Note 12
Press 7 or F7: Disable Driver Signature Enforcement
All 64-bit editions of Windows require that kernel-mode drivers be digitally signed. Developers use this option to
disable driver signature enforcement when they test kernel-mode device drivers that are not yet digitally signed.
Use this option for troubleshooting with caution because doing so might allow malware drivers to load.
To permanently disable automatic restarts, right-click Start, click System, and in the About window, click Advanced
system settings. In the Startup and Recovery group of the System Properties dialog box, click Settings. In the Startup
and Recovery dialog box, uncheck Automatically restart (see Figure 15-23). Click OK twice and close the About window.
Note 13
Figure 15-23 Permanently disable automatic restarts
Press 8 or F8: Disable Early Launch Anti-Malware Protection
Windows allows anti-malware software to launch a driver before any third-party drivers are launched so it can scan
these drivers for malware. Unless you’re sure a driver is the problem, don’t disable this security feature.
Press 9 or F9: Disable Automatic Restart after Failure
By default, Windows automatically restarts immediately after a blue screen of death (BSOD) stop error, which is
described in more detail later in this module. The error can cause the system to continually reboot rather than shut
down. Press F9 to disable automatic restarts and stop the rebooting.

Press F10: Return to the Startup Settings Screen
Press F10 to return to the Windows 10 Startup Menu screen shown previously in Figure 15-14. For Windows 11, select
Start Windows Normally to restart Windows.
As you use these startup settings tools, be sure to reboot after each attempt to fix the problem to make sure it has
not been resolved before you try another tool. To exit Windows RE and relaunch Windows, press Enter on the Startup
Settings screen.
Note 14
System Restore
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Windows gives you several opportunities during the startup troubleshooting process to use System Restore to
restore the system to an earlier point in time when a restore point was made. You can select System Restore from
the Windows RE Advanced options screen (refer back to Figure 15-16). You can also perform System Restore in Safe
Mode or from a command prompt with the rstrui command.
System Restore can cause problems of its own because Windows updates and updates to anti-malware software
can be lost, and hardware devices and applications might need to be reinstalled. System Restore won’t help if the
file system is corrupted or the registry is trashed. In these situations, the command prompt might help.
Uninstall Updates
Core 2 Objective 1.9
If you suspect a recent Windows update is preventing Windows from starting, you can uninstall or roll back updates.
To uninstall a Windows update, you would normally use the Update & Security window in the Settings app or the
Programs and Features window in Control Panel. But if Windows refuses to start, use the Advanced options screen in
Windows RE. If there are recent updates, the screen shows the option to Uninstall Updates (see Figure 15-24). Click
Uninstall Updates and follow directions on-screen. This method works well when the system fails to start because a
critical driver is corrupted. In a project at the end of this module, you learn to use the DISM commands to roll back
an update that refuses to uninstall by normal means.
Figure 15-24 After recent Windows updates, the option to roll back an
update appears on the Advanced options screen

The Command Prompt Window in Windows RE
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Use the command prompt window in Windows RE when the graphical interface is missing or corrupted or when you
want to use a specific command to fix a problem when Windows refuses to start. To access the Windows RE command prompt, click Command Prompt on the Windows Advanced options screen (refer back to Figure 15-16). After
you have signed in with an account with administrative privileges, you have full read and write access to all files on
all drives. The command prompt you first see in the window (see Figure 15-25) is X:\windows\system32> because
Windows RE assigns drive X: to the drive containing the Windows installation. Many commands you learned about
in module “Maintaining Windows” can be used at this command prompt.
Figure 15-25 The command prompt window in Windows RE
Command Line Description
bootrec /scanOS Scans the hard drive for Windows installations not stored in the BCD
bootrec /rebuildBCD Scans for Windows installations and rebuilds the BCD
bootrec /fixboot Repairs the boot sector of the system partition
bootrec /fixmbr Repairs the MBR for hard drives using the MBR partitioning system
bcdedit /enum Displays the contents of the BCD
Table 15-2 Bootrec and bcdedit commands to repair system files and the file system
Next are some examples of how to use the Windows RE command prompt to repair a system. After you try each
fix, reboot the system to see if the problem is solved before you try the next fix:
●● Manage data files and system files. As you learned in the module “Troubleshooting Windows After Startup,”
you can use the SFC or DISM commands to restore critical Windows system files. The cd, copy, rename, and
delete commands can be used to manage data files and system files.
●● Repair the hard drive file system. A corrupted file system can cause a failure to boot. To repair the file
system, try the chkdsk /r command.
●● Wipe the hard drive clean to prepare for a new Windows installation. If you decide the hard drive is so
corrupted you must start over with a fresh installation of Windows, you can use the diskpart command to
totally wipe the hard drive clean of everything, including the partitioning system, before you install Windows
again using Windows setup media. You learned to do this in module “Installing Windows.”
●● Enable networking. Networking is not normally available from the Windows RE command prompt. Use the
wpeinit command to enable networking. The wpeinit command initializes Windows PE. Recall from the
module “Installing Windows” that Windows PE is the preinstallation-environment operating system that is
launched prior to installing Windows in a clean install and includes networking components.
●● Repair the BCD and boot sectors. A failure to boot can be caused by a corrupted BCD. Startup Repair should
fix the problem. But on some legacy systems, you will need to manually repair the BCD. Use the bootrec
command to repair the BCD and boot sectors. Use the bcdedit command to manually edit the BCD. (Be sure
to make a copy of the BCD before you edit it.) Use the bootsect command to repair a dual-boot system. To
get helpful information about these commands, enter the command followed by /?, such as bcdedit /?. Some
examples of the bootrec and bcdedit commands are listed in Table 15-2.

Although a Startup Repair should solve the problem when you get an error message at startup that “Bootmgr is
missing,” rebuilding the BCD store should also be able to resolve the same problem on a legacy BIOS and MBR system.
Tools to Reinstall Windows
Core 2 Objectives 1.9, 3.1
After you have made reasonable efforts to repair a Windows installation, your next option is to reinstall Windows.
The tools discussed in this section of the module affect the entire Windows installation on a computer rather than
a few files or settings. Look back at Figure 15-7 and notice that these tools to reinstall Windows are shown in blue
boxes; you can also see how to reach each tool. Some of these options allow you to keep personal data, and other
options remove that data; the tools are listed here, starting with the least intrusive solutions:
1. Go back to the previous version of Windows. After you have upgraded to Windows 10/11 and the
system is giving problems, you can go back to the previous version of Windows. This option is available
on the Advanced options screen after upgrading to Windows 10/11 if the upgrade is not too old and the
Windows.old folder is present. See Figure 15-26. In addition, you’ll find the option in the Settings app: go
to Update & Security and click Recovery.
Figure 15-26 The option to go back to a previous version is
available because this computer was recently
upgraded to Windows 10
2. Windows 10/11 repair installation. Install Windows 10/11 as an upgrade over the existing installation,
keeping personal data, apps, Windows settings, and device drivers.
3. Reimage Windows 10/11. Use a system image or deployment image to replace everything on the
Windows volume. Current user data, Windows settings, apps, and device drives are lost.
4. Install Windows 10/11 from the OEM recovery partition. Laptops, all-in-ones, and brand-name
computers may have an OEM recovery partition on the hard drive that can be used to restore the
system to factory state. Some manufacturer procedures allow user data to be kept.
5. Windows 10/11 reset. Do a clean Windows 10/11 installation from the Microsoft cloud, recovery media, or the
recovery partition on the hard drive. User data and preinstalled apps in a recovery partition can be restored.
6. Windows 10/11 clean install from setup media. This method, which is covered in module “Installing
Windows,” may allow you to keep user data on the hard drive.
Let’s see how the Windows repair installation, reimage, OEM recovery partition, and reset work.

Windows 10/11 Repair Installation
Core 2 Objective 1.9
If you’re having problems with Windows updates or basic Windows functionality but you can still boot into Windows,
you might consider performing a repair installation, also known as a repair upgrade or in-place upgrade. A repair
installation is a nondestructive installation of Windows 10/11 over an existing Windows installation. This is not the
same as a full reinstall because the Windows volume will not be reformatted. Just as with an upgrade from Windows
8 to Windows 10, you can keep personal files, apps, and Windows settings. Essentially, you trick the machine into
thinking it’s being upgraded while potentially repairing the Windows installation.
Keep these points in mind when doing a repair installation:
●● Create Windows setup media, on either DVD or USB, or save an ISO file on the local hard drive.
●● Make sure that you can fully boot into Windows 10/11. If you can’t, you’ll have to use a different troubleshooting tool.
●● Even though all data, apps, and settings should be protected in a repair installation, make a backup just in case.
●● Gather all product keys for all installed apps to make reinstallation of these apps easier should it become
necessary.
Belarc Advisor (belarc.com) is a free tool that is quick and easy to use. It will produce a list of all installed devices and
apps along with their product keys if that information is available. Print a copy of the report, and keep it in a safe place.
Note 15
Performing a Repair Installation
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
The easiest way to perform a repair installation is to start with an ISO file created by the Media Creation Tool, as
described in the module “Installing Windows.” Complete the following steps:
1. Sign in to Windows using an administrator account. Back up all personal data using one of the methods
you learned about in the module “Maintaining Windows.”
2. Following steps in the module “Installing Windows,” download the correct ISO file for the Windows
installation you’re currently using on the computer to be repaired.
3. In Explorer, double-click the ISO file that you created with the Media Creation Tool. This mounts the image
and shows the included files.
4. Double-click setup.exe, as shown in Figure 15-27. Click Yes in response to the UAC dialog box, and follow
the directions on-screen.

only, or nothing. Sometimes setup makes these decisions for you and skips directly to the Ready to install window.
6. On the Ready to install window, make sure Keep personal files and apps appears and is checked, as
shown in Figure 15-28. If it does not, click Change what to keep and select Keep personal files and
apps, and then click Next to return to the Ready to install window. Click Install to begin the installation
process, which will take a while and require several restarts. Enjoy a cup of tea or coffee while you wait.
7. When the sign-in screen appears, sign in to Windows. Once you see the desktop, all your files, apps, and settings
should still be in place.

Applying a Windows System Image
Core 2 Objectives 1.9, 3.1
You learned how to create a system image in the module “Maintaining Windows.” System image recovery, sometimes
called a reimage, tends to be an all-or-nothing recovery option with which you replace the entire contents of a hard
drive with whatever operating system state and personal data are saved in the system image. It recovers all personal
files, system files, and installed apps that were in place at the time the system image was most recently created
or updated. If your system image is updated regularly, this option could work very well for you when repairing or
replacing hardware, such as a failed hard drive. However, if a software-related problem has been building for a while,
a recently updated system image won’t necessarily fix the root of the problem.
To reimage Windows using a system image file stored locally (for example, on a flash drive or on the local network,) reboot the computer into Windows RE, drill down to the Advanced options screen (refer back to Figure 15-16),
and select System Image Recovery.
Recall from the module “Installing Windows” that in an enterprise environment, you can install Windows from
a deployment image on the network. Go into BIOS/UEFI setup and look for an advanced setup screen to enable PXE
Support. Then reboot the computer to the network where it finds and loads Windows PE on the deployment server.
The computer then boots to the Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE), and PXE then searches for a server on the
network to provide the deployment image.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know how to use a preinstallation environment and a recovery image to reimage
Windows.
OEM Factory Recovery Partition
Core 2 Objectives 1.3, 1.9
Laptops, all-in-one computers, and brand-name desktops come with the OS preinstalled at the factory. This OEM
(original equipment manufacturer) build of the OS is likely to be customized, and for laptops, the drivers might be
specific to proprietary devices installed in the laptops.
Recall that a laptop or brand-name computer is likely to have a recovery partition on the hard drive used to
restore the system to its factory state. This partition might or might not be hidden. For example, Figure 15-29 shows
the Disk Management information for a hard drive on one laptop that has a 16.38 GB recovery partition.

Figure 15-30 For this laptop, press the ASSIST button during the boot to launch programs on
the recovery partition
Figure 15-29 This laptop hard drive has a 16.38 GB recovery partition that can be used to
recover the system
To know how to access the recovery tools stored on a recovery partition, see the manufacturer’s website or
look for a message at the beginning of the boot, such as “Press ESC for diagnostics” or “Press F12 to recover the
system.” For one Sony laptop, you press the red ASSIST button during the boot (see Figure 15-30). When you press
the key or button, a menu appears with options to diagnose the problem, to repair the current OS installation, or to
completely rebuild the entire hard drive to its factory state.
If the laptop doesn’t have a recovery partition or if the partition is corrupted, look for the option to download
recovery media from the manufacturer’s website, and use it to create a bootable USB flash drive or DVD. You can
then use the media to install Windows to its factory state.
When you first become responsible for a laptop, use a USB flash drive to make a Windows recovery drive that includes
the OEM recovery partition in case you must replace the laptop’s hard drive. Know that if the laptop is more than three
years old, the manufacturer might no longer provide the recovery media. You learned how to create a recovery drive
earlier in the module. It is also important to save a copy of the power-on password in a safe place.

Caution
Before upgrading a laptop to Windows 10/11, make sure the laptop manufacturer provides Windows 10 or
Windows 11 drivers for laptop components.
All options remove apps and drivers installed by the user and all changes made to settings. After the reset, a list
of apps deleted from the system is stored on the Windows desktop. You’ll then need to reinstall the apps you want
to keep. Here are the ways in which the options differ:
●● Option 1 keeps all personal files. All apps and settings are lost, and you get a clean installation of Windows.
●● Option 2 keeps all personal files. If the computer came from a manufacturer with Windows 10/11 preinstalled,
you can decide to restore the preinstalled apps (sometimes called bloatware) from the manufacturer. The
apps, drivers, and diagnostics programs are reinstalled using the recovery partition on the hard drive or a
recovery drive you created earlier.
●● Option 3 removes everything on the drive, and you can also choose to clean the drive. Then Windows is
reinstalled. If a recovery partition or recovery drive is present, the system is restored to factory state. This
is an excellent choice if you are planning to sell, donate, or recycle your computer.

Troubleshooting Windows Startup
Core 2 Objective 3.1
And now the fun begins! With your understanding of the boot process and Windows tools for troubleshooting
startup in hand, let’s work through a bunch of errors and problems that can affect Windows startup and see what
can be done about them. As with any computer problem, follow the troubleshooting steps you’ve learned in previous modules: (1) To identify the problem, interview the user, back up important data or verify that you have current backups, research and identify any error messages, and determine what has just changed that might be the
source of the problem. (2) Establish your theory of probable cause. Be sure to search the web on error messages
and symptoms. You’re then ready to (3) test your theory and (4) resolve the problem. After you think the problem
is solved, and (5) verify all is working as it should, implement preventive measures. Don’t forget to (6) document
your findings, actions, and outcomes.
When you know the source of the problem, decide which tool will be the least invasive to use yet still fix the
problem. If that doesn’t work, move on to the next tool. Remember that the tools are described earlier in the module
in order from least to most invasive.
Important Data on the Hard Drive
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Working on a computer problem should always start with the most important question: Is there important data on the
hard drive that’s not backed up? Even if data is lost or corrupted, you might be able to recover it using Windows tools,
third-party file recovery software, or commercial data recovery services. One good product is GetDataBack by Runtime
Software (runtime.org), which can recover data and program files even when Windows cannot recognize the drive.
For less than $30, you can purchase a SATA-to-USB converter kit (see Figure 15-33) that includes a data cable
and power adapter. You can use one of these kits to temporarily connect a desktop or laptop hard drive to a USB
port on a working computer. Set the drive beside your computer and plug one end of the data cable into the drive
and the other into the USB port. The AC adapter supplies power to the drive. While power is getting to the drive, be
careful not to touch the circuit board on the drive.
Using Explorer, you can browse the drive and copy data to other media. After you have saved the data, you can
use diagnostic software from the hard drive manufacturer to examine the drive and possibly repair it or return the
drive to its own computer and start troubleshooting there.

Error Messages and Problems
Core 2 Objective 3.1
Problems that prevent Windows from booting can be caused by hardware, device drivers, services, applications, or
Windows. This section covers what to do when error messages appear on a black or blue screen or when Windows
gets corrupted.
Startup Error Messages on a Black Screen
Generally, problems that present as white text on a black screen are caused by hardware. Here are some possible
error messages:
●● No OS found
●● A disk read error occurred
●● Invalid boot disk
●● Hard drive not found
●● Disk boot failure
●● No boot device found
Here is what’s happening and what to do about it:
1. Start with the error message. Research the text shown on the screen so you understand the problem and
get solutions from trusted websites.
2. If you see spinning white dots on a black screen, Windows may be installing updates before it launches.
Wait. It may take some time for the update installations to complete. If the system hangs indefinitely, the
updates might be causing a problem. If a reboot doesn’t solve the problem, boot into Windows RE, and
roll back updates or return to a previous version of Windows. Next try System Restore.
3. Consider that startup BIOS/UEFI might not be able to communicate with the hard drive. Check BIOS/
UEFI setup for the boot sequence. Update the boot order so you can try booting from another device.
4. Try going into BIOS/UEFI setup and disabling any quick boot features. This causes BIOS/UEFI to do
a more thorough job of POST and reports more information on the screen as it performs POST.
5. Windows might halt and show a black screen when it encounters a video problem at startup. Try restarting
the system in Safe Mode, as you learned to do earlier in the module. Then check Event Viewer for clues,
update Windows, use Device Manager to roll back drivers or disable or uninstall the video adapter, and
use System File Checker. If you cannot boot into Safe Mode, launch Windows RE, and use Startup Repair,
Memory Diagnostics, and the chkdsk /r command to check Windows, memory, and the hard drive.
6. The hard drive might be failing. To recover data from the drive, move it to another computer, and install
it as a second hard drive.
Problems With User Profiles
If Windows bogs down right after the user signs in, the problem might be with loading the user profile. For a slow
profile load, the user might see a black screen with spinning dots for several minutes. To fix the problem, try these
tasks listed in the least invasive order:
1. Make sure Windows updates are applied.
2. Use the sfc /scannow command to fix problems with system files.
3. Reduce startup items. Compare the time to load a user profile when starting Windows normally and
during a clean boot.
4. Apply a restore point that was created before the problem started.
5. Perform a repair installation.
6. Create a new user profile. You can copy user data files from the old profile into the new user profile
namespace. (Locations of these files are given in the module “Troubleshooting Windows After Startup.”)

If the user profile gets corrupted, it might not load at all, and you might see the error message, “The User Profile Service
failed the logon.” To rebuild the user profiles, do the following to repair Windows system files that affect the corrupted profiles:
●● Do as many of the previous steps as you can do when a single user profile is slow to load.
●● Following directions given in the module “Troubleshooting Windows After Startup,” use the DISM commands
to repair corrupted Windows system files.
●● Perform a Windows reset. Be sure to back up data before you do a reset.
Sometimes you can recover a user account by deleting it without deleting its files and then creating a new one
with the same name.
To delete the account and keep its files, open Control Panel, click User Accounts, select the account, and click
Delete the account. In the Delete Account window (see Figure 15-34), click Keep Files and then click Delete Account.
The files are stored in a folder on your desktop, and the account and its settings are deleted. Create a new account
with the same name. Then you can copy the files saved to your desktop folder to the new user profile namespace.
Figure 15-34 Delete a user account and its settings, and keep the files in the user profile
Figure 15-35 Set the State subkey value to 0
If this doesn’t work, you can edit the registry to delete an old profile or repair a corrupted one:
1. Launch the Registry Editor and back up this registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
2. Drill down into each S-1-5 folder in the key in Step 1 until you find the correct user profile in the
ProfileImagePath subkey (see Figure 15-35). If the profile has a State subkey, set it to 0, as shown in the
figure. If the profile has a RefCount subkey, set it to 0.
3. Close the Registry Editor, and restart the computer.

If you still have problems with a user profile, you can follow these steps to delete the profile:
1. Manually copy any important data files in the user profile namespace to a new location. Recall that you
can find these files in the C:\Users\username subfolders.
2. Go to Control Panel and open the System window. Click Advanced system settings. In the System
Properties dialog box, select the Advanced tab, and click Settings under User Profiles. See Figure 15-36.
In the list of user profiles, select the profile and click Delete.

If you’re searching for the correct S-1-5 folder and it has .bak in the name, remove .bak from the folder name. To rename
a folder, right-click it and click Rename.
If you see two S-1-5 folders with the same name, except one has .bak at the end, you must switch the names: First
rename the folder that does not contain .bak to .hold. Then remove the .bak from the other folder name. Next, rename
the .hold folder to .bak. Then edit the S-1-5 folder that does not have .bak in the name.

Error Messages on a Blue Screen
Hardware and software errors can present as error messages on a Windows blue screen of death (BSOD) and are
called stop errors. Also, sometimes Windows hangs with the pinwheel spinning, continuously restarts, or does an
abrupt and improper shutdown. A BSOD, or stop error, happens when processes running in kernel mode encounter
a problem and Windows must stop the system. Figure 15-37 shows a Windows 10 blue screen stop error.

A stop error can be caused by a corrupted Windows update, a corrupted registry, a system file that is missing or
damaged, a device driver that is missing or damaged, bad memory, or a corrupted or failing hard drive. Stop errors
can occur during or after startup. Here’s what to do when you get a stop error:
1. As for the tools that are useful in solving stop errors, put the web at the top of your list! (But don’t forget
that some sites are unreliable, and others mean you harm.) Search the Microsoft websites on the text
labeled in Figure 15-37, or use your smartphone to scan the QR code, which takes you directly to the
BSOD webpages by Microsoft.
2. Disconnect any peripheral devices that might be causing trouble, such as a docking station, USB device,
projector, or extra monitor.
3. Reboot the system. Immediately after a reboot following a stop error, Windows displays an error
message box or bubble with useful information. Follow the links in the box.
4. If possible, restart the system and enable boot logging. Check the C:\Windows\ntbtlog.txt file to see if
the correct driver files loaded.
5. Restart the computer a couple of times. Sometimes that’s all you need to do to solve a problem. If
Windows encounters errors, it will launch an automatic repair. If that doesn’t fix the problem, you can
launch Windows RE and restart Windows in Safe Mode with Networking. In Safe Mode, examine the log
file created by Automatic Repair at C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt. See Figure 15-38.
Also, recall that Safe Mode creates its own log file at C:\Windows\ntbtlog.txt.
Figure 15-37 A Windows 10 stop error screen
If the stop error prevents Windows from loading the desktop and F8 has not yet been enabled at startup, you can force
automatic repair by turning off the computer a couple of times as Windows launches.

Errors With Hardware and Device Drivers
If the blue screen names a device or device driver that caused the problem, do the following:
1. A Windows update might fix the problem. Open the Settings app, and update Windows.
2. If the driver has been recently updated and the Safe Mode desktop is loaded, open Device Manager and
roll back the driver.
3. Consider that the device driver might have been updated along with a Windows update. For recent
Windows updates, try to roll back the updates or return to a previous version of Windows.
4. Use Device Manager to uninstall the device. When given the option, select Delete the driver software
for this device. Then reboot the system.
5. If the stop error does not identify the device but names a program file, open Explorer on a working
computer to locate the program file. Driver files are stored in the C:\Windows\System32\drivers folder.
Right-click the file and select Properties from the shortcut menu. The Details tab of the Properties dialog
box tells you the purpose of the file (see Figure 15-39). You can then reinstall the device or program that
caused the problem.

Figure 15-39 Use the Details tab of a driver’s Properties dialog box to identify the purpose of the driver
Caution
Consider that the device might be physically damaged. If you feel excessive heat coming from the computer case or a
peripheral device, immediately unplug the device or power down the system. Don’t turn the device or system back on until
the problem is solved; you don’t want to start a fire! Other symptoms that indicate potential danger are strong electrical
odors, unusual noises, no noise (such as when the fan is not working to keep the system cool), liquid spills on a device, and
visible damage such as a frayed cable, melted plastic, or smoke. In these situations, turn off the equipment immediately.
6. If you cannot start Windows in Safe Mode, use Windows RE to open a command prompt window. Then
back up the registry, and open the Registry Editor using the regedit command. Drill down to the service
or device key. The key that loads services and drivers can be found in this location:
HKEY__LOCAL__MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
Disable the service or driver by changing the Start value to 0x4. Close the Registry Editor and reboot. If
the problem goes away, use the copy command to replace the service or driver program file, and restart
the service or driver.
Improper or Frequent Shutdowns
Problems with improper or frequent shutdowns can be caused by overheating, a hardware problem, or the
Windows kernel. After a restart, check Event Viewer for clues, apply Windows updates, verify memory with Memory
Diagnostics, and use Check Disk (chkdsk /r) to check the hard drive for errors.
Next, consider that Windows might be corrupted. First try the least invasive solutions to repair Windows, including
updating Windows, System File Checker, Startup Repair, running the system in Safe Mode, and System Restore.
If you decide the Windows installation is beyond repair, it’s time to reimage or reinstall Windows. As you learned
in this module, the tools to use in the least intrusive order are roll back Windows updates, Windows previous version
(if available), Windows 10/11 repair installation, reimage Windows, reinstall Windows from the OEM recovery partition,
and Windows 10/11 reset. After you have Windows up and running again, you can restore the user data from backups.

Module Summary
Understanding the Boot Process
●● When you first turn on a system, startup BIOS/UEFI on the motherboard takes control and performs POST
to examine hardware components and then find an operating system to load.
●● Windows startup is managed by the Windows Boot Manager. For a BIOS system, the program is Bootmgr.
For a UEFI system, the program is Bootmgfw.efi. The Windows Boot Loader is Winload.exe or Winload.efi.
The Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store contains Windows startup settings.
●● The Session Manager (Smss.exe) runs in user mode and interacts with applications.
What to Do Before a Problem Occurs
●● Before a startup problem occurs, you can keep good backups, turn on System Restore, create a system
image, configure the F8 key at startup, and create recovery boot media.
Tools for Solving Windows Startup Problems
●● The Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE or WinRE) can be started from within Windows, from
the Windows setup DVD or flash drive, from a recovery drive, or from a system repair disc.
●● Tools for startup troubleshooting include Windows RE; Startup Repair; startup settings; System Restore;
Safe Mode; enabling boot logging; uninstalling updates; SFC; and the chkdsk, diskpart, bootrec, and bootsect
commands.
Tools to Reinstall Windows
●● Tools that can be used to reinstall Windows are Windows 10/11 previous version, repair installation, reimaging Windows, recovery partition, and reset. Some manufacturers offer a recovery partition on the hard
drive to restore a computer to factory state. You can also reinstall Windows from Windows setup media.
Troubleshooting Windows Startup
●● If a hard drive contains valuable data but will not boot, you might be able to recover the data by installing
the drive in another system as the second, nonbooting hard drive.
●● Use the web to research stop errors by the QR code, error title, and error number listed on a black or blue
screen.
●● Slow profile loads can be solved by updating Windows, System File Checker, reducing startup items, System
Restore, repair installation, and new user profiles.
●● When a device or service causes the system to hang during a normal boot, boot into Safe Mode or perform
a clean boot and uninstall and install the device or service. System Restore can return the system to a previously saved restore point before the problem occurred.
●● Improper and frequent shutdowns are most likely hardware related. Event Viewer might record failures. Use
Memory Diagnostics and chkdsk to check memory and the hard drive. Consider overheating or a corrupted
Windows installation as a source of the problem.

Hands-On Projects
Using Boot Logs and System Information to Research Startup
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
Boot logs can be used to generate a list of drivers that were loaded during a normal startup and during a Safe Mode
startup. Do the following to use boot logs to research startup:
1. Boot to the normal Windows desktop with boot logging enabled. Save the boot log just created to a
different name or location so it will not be overwritten on the next boot.
2. Reboot the system in Safe Mode, which also creates a boot log. Compare the two logs, identifying
differences in drivers loaded during the two boots. You can print both files and lay them side by side for
comparison. An easier method is to compare the files using the Compare tool in Microsoft Word.

Taking Ownership and Replacing a Windows System File
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.9
In the module “Troubleshooting Windows After Startup,” you learned to use SFC and DISM commands to find and
replace corrupted Windows system files. SFC keeps a log of its actions at C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log, and DISM
keeps a log at C:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log. Sometimes these logs or BSOD error screens reveal the name and
location of corrupted system or device driver files that Windows tools cannot replace. In this situation, you can manually replace the file. To do so, you can use the takeown command to take ownership of a file and the icacls command
to get full access to the file. The Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 929833 at support.microsoft.com explains how to
use these two commands.
Do the following to practice manually replacing a system file:
1. Boot the computer into Safe Mode with Command Prompt.
2. Take ownership and gain full access to the C:\Windows\System32\jscript.dll file. What commands did
you use?
3. Rename the Jscript.dll file to Jscript.dll.hold. Run the sfc /scannow command. Did SFC restore the
Jscript.dll file? What is the path and file name of the log file that lists repairs?
4. SFC restores a file using files accessed from Windows Update or stored on the Windows setup DVD or other
folders on the hard drive. If SFC cannot restore a file, you might find a fresh copy in the C:\Windows\winsxs
folder or its subfolders. Search these folders. Did you find a version of Jscript.dll that is the same file size
as the one in C:\Windows\System32? Other than the C:\Windows\winsxs folder, where else can you find a
known good copy of a corrupted system file or device driver file?
Hands-On Project 15-2
3. Use the System Information utility or other methods to identify the hardware devices loaded during normal
startup but not loaded in Safe Mode. Which devices on your system did not load in Safe Mode?
As you identify the drivers not loaded during Safe Mode, these registry keys might help with your research:
●● Lists drivers and services loaded during Safe Mode:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal
●● Lists drivers and services loaded during Safe Mode with Networking:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network
Hands-On Project Continued
To use a command prompt window to search for a file in a folder and its subfolders, use the dir /s command.

Researching Laptop Online Resources
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.9
Suppose the hard drive in a laptop has failed, and you must replace the hard drive with a new one and then install
Windows on the new drive. What online resources can help you? Do the following to find a service manual and
recovery files for a laptop to which you have access, such as one you or a friend owns:
1. What are the brand, model, and serial number of the laptop?
2. What is the website of the laptop manufacturer? Save or print a webpage on that site that shows you what
recovery files you can download to install Windows on a new hard drive for the laptop.
3. If the website provides a service manual, download the manual and print the pages that show how to
replace the hard drive.
4. Based on what you have learned about online support for this laptop, what backups or recovery media do
you think need to be created now, before a hard drive crash occurs?
Hands-On Project 15-4
Practicing Using System Recovery Options
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.9
Launch Windows RE and do the following:
1. Execute the Startup Repair process. What were the results?
2. Launch System Restore. What is the most recent restore point? (Do not apply the restore point.)
3. Using the command prompt window, open the Registry Editor. What command did you use? Close the
editor.
4. Using the command prompt window, copy a file from your Documents folder to a flash drive. Were you able
to copy the file successfully? If not, what error message(s) did you receive?
Hands-On Project 15-5
Using Startup Repair
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
When Startup Repair attempts to fix a system, it creates a log file with information about the steps taken during
the repair process. If Startup Repair doesn’t fix the system, you can use the log file to investigate the problem and
perhaps manually fix it. Do the following to practice using Startup Repair and examine its log file:
1. Use the Settings app in Windows to launch Windows RE. From the initial Windows Startup Menu, click
Troubleshoot, Advanced options, and then Startup Repair.

2. Diagnostics of the system are made, and the location of the log file appears. Note the path and name of
the file. The default location of the log file is C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt. Click Advanced
options. You are returned to the Windows Startup Menu.
3. To view the log file from the Windows RE command prompt, click Troubleshoot and click Command
Prompt.
4. In the command prompt window, enter the command c: to access the hard drive. (You might need to use a
different drive depending on the log file location reported in Step 2.)
5. Enter the following command to go to the directory where the log file is located:
cd \Windows\System32\LogFiles\SRT
6. To use Notepad to view the file contents, enter the following command:
notepad.exe SRTTrail.txt
7. In the log file, look for information about a failed test.
Using the DISM Commands
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
Sometimes a Windows update crashes the system, and uninstalling the update doesn’t work in the Settings app and
in Windows RE. Another way to roll back the update is with the DISM commands. Do the following:
1. Launch the Windows RE command prompt window.
2. Enter this command to get a list of installed updates: dism /online /get-packages
3. Search through the list, and find the most recent one. Find the Package Identity. It’s a long string that you
will need to copy by selecting it and pressing Ctrl1C.
4. Don’t uninstall the update. But if you intended to uninstall the update, you would use this command:
dism /online /remove-package /PackageName:[Insert the copied Package
Identity here]
5. DISM keeps a log at C:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log. Open the log file in Notepad. Can you find the
Package Identify string you copied in step 3? Where do you think DISM got its information about installed
updates?

Real Problems, Real Solutions
Sabotaging a Windows System
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
In a lab environment, follow these steps to find out if you can corrupt a Windows system so that it will not boot, and
then repair the system. (This problem can be done using a Windows installation in a virtual machine.) Don’t forget
about the powerful takeown and icacls commands discussed in this module.
1. Rename or move one of the program files listed in Table 15-1. Which program file did you select? In what
folder did you find it?
2. Restart your system. Did an error occur? Check in Explorer. Is the file restored? What Windows feature
repaired the problem?
3. Try other methods of sabotaging the Windows system, but carefully record exactly what you did to sabotage
the boot. Can you make the boot fail?
4. Now recover the Windows system. List the steps you took to get the system back to good working order.

Recovering Data from a Hard Drive
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.1
To practice recovering data from a hard drive that won’t boot, create a folder on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 VM.
Put data files in the folder. What is the name of your folder? Move the hard drive to another working VM, and install
it as a second hard drive in the system. Copy the data folder to the primary hard drive in this second VM. Now return
the hard drive to the original VM, and verify that the VM starts with no errors. List the steps you used in this project.

Introduction
This module is the first of four modules focused on security. In this module, you learn about physical and logical tools
and techniques used to secure buildings and the resources inside these buildings stored on personal computers and
servers and accessible from the local network. You also learn how to recognize that a personal computer is infected
with malware and how to clean an infected system and keep it clean. Finally, you learn what your employer might
expect of you when dealing with issues of software licensing, regulated data, compliance policies, data destruction
and disposal, and incidence response.
In later modules focused on security, you learn the concepts and principles of securing Windows resources
on workstations and networks, securing mobile devices, and securing networks. Later in your career as a support
technician, you can build on the skills learned in these modules to implement even more security measures, such
as controlling how Windows stores its passwords.
However, keep in mind that even the best security will eventually fail. As a thief once said, “Locks are for honest people,” and a thief will eventually find a way to break through. Security experts tell us that security measures
basically make it more difficult and time consuming for a thief to break through so they get discouraged and move
on to easier targets.
Physical and Logical Security
Core 2 Objectives 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 3.3
In this section of the module, you learn about both physical and logical methods of protecting computer resources,
including how to control staff access to these resources.
Physical Security and Access Controls
Core 2 Objectives 2.1, 2.6
Physically protecting access to a computer’s resources is often seen by security experts as the most important—and
most overlooked—form of security. Here are some best practices for physical security used to protect buildings,
parking lots, corporate campuses, or other locations:
●● Use security fences and bollards to protect the building. Your first line of defense to protect valuable
data and property is to secure the building through the use of physical barriers such as a security fence.
A high wire-mesh security fence installed in concrete footings with a secure gate eliminates any possible
hiding places and is difficult for someone to climb over or get under, around, or through it. Bollards, which
are strong metal posts positioned to prevent vehicles from accidentally or intentionally ramming into a
protected space, can be used to help protect equipment and the entrance to a building, or to direct traffic.
See Figure 16-1.
3.3 Given a scenario, use best practice procedures for malware
removal.
4.1 Given a scenario, implement best practices associated
with documentation and support systems information
management.
4.6 Explain the importance of prohibited content/activity and
privacy, licensing, and policy concepts.

●● Use an access control vestibule and security guard. The ultimate in physical security is an access control
vestibule, also called a mantrap, which consists of two doors on either end of a small entryway where the
first door must close and/or lock before the second door can open. A separate form of identification might be
required for each door, such as a wired or wireless badge reader to scan staff badges for the first door (see
Figure 16-2) and a fingerprint scanner for the second door. A security guard might also maintain an entry
control roster, which is a list of people allowed into the restricted area and a log of any approved visitors.

Good security involves multiple layers of defense, which are collectively called defense in depth.
Note 1
The system typically requires large-capacity storage to keep recordings for several days, weeks, or
months. Some systems allow real-time monitoring only at one security location or over the Internet, and
other systems don’t allow real-time monitoring at all; recordings must be viewed after they happen. Important
security considerations for a video surveillance system include who in the organization is authorized to
view the video and in what capacity the video recordings can be used.
●● Alarm systems. Alarm systems generally use a low-voltage electrical system installed on doors and windows, motion sensors, and perhaps even smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. When alarm sensors
detect an interruption in electrical flow or motion, they set off sirens or strobe lights to scare off intruders
and wake up sleeping residents, or they may send alerts via text message or phone call to notify security
personnel responsible for monitoring the system. An alarm system needs a control panel or other method
to stop the alerts when authorized activity is happening.
●● Metal detectors. A metal detector (see Figure 16-4) uses a magnetometer, which detects electromagnetic
fields to detect metal objects, such as handguns. Metal detectors are often placed at the front entrance to
buildings supervised by security personnel.
●● Video surveillance. A video surveillance system includes cameras installed in strategic locations by a government, organization, or school that are monitored for improper activity. A surveillance camera, sometimes
called an IP camera, has an IP address to connect it to the local network and is considered a part of the
Internet of Things (IoT). It can transmit output to video surveillance software anywhere on the Internet via
a wired or wireless connection. Cameras, such as those shown in Figure 16-3, may be fixed or may be able to
pan, tilt, or zoom and may have night vision or require proper lighting to work well. A surveillance camera
may have a motion sensor that can alert security personnel when activity is happening in the vicinity of
the camera and turn on recording.

Next, we look at physical security focused on protecting data and computers:
●● If the data or equipment is really private, keep it behind a locked door or under lock and key. You can
use all kinds of security methods to encrypt, password-protect, and hide data, but if it really is that important, one obvious thing you can do is to keep the computer behind a locked door. It sounds simple, but it
works. You can also store the data on a removable storage device such as an external hard drive, and when
you’re not using the data, put the drive in a fireproof safe. (And, of course, keep two copies stored in different locations.) Don’t forget that printouts of sensitive documents should be kept under lock and key, as
well as any passwords you have written down. Door locks and safes come in several types, including keyed
locks and combination locks.
●● Equipment locks. Some computer cases allow you to add a lock so you can physically prevent others from
opening the case (see Figure 16-5A). These equipment locks, called server locks, might be used on computers that hold corporate data. You can also use a cable lock, or Kensington lock, to secure a laptop or other
computer to a table so someone can’t walk away with it (see Figure 16-5B). Most laptops have a security
slot on the case to connect the cable lock; this slot is called a Kensington Security Slot or K-Slot. Many
thefts occur in private offices or hotel rooms, so even if you’re not sitting in a public area with your laptop,
consider keeping it locked to a nearby table or post. Be sure to choose a cable lock that resists tampering
with pliers or cable cutters. Never leave a device out of your sight in a public place.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Secure ports with port locks. Any exposed port on a device, such as an RJ-45 port or a USB port, can be
used to access the device and compromise its security. USB ports in particular are security risks due to
the ease of uploading malware or downloading sensitive data using a small flash drive carried in someone’s
pocket. If you can’t restrict access to the device itself, you might install a port lock to restrict physical
access to the exposed ports. The USB lock by PadJack, Inc., consists of three pieces, as shown in Figure 16-6.
The smaller two pieces are inserted into the USB port, sealed into place with the wire loop, and cannot be
removed without damaging the port or destroying the lock. Other port lock designs can lock a cable into
the port so it can’t be easily removed.

●● Use privacy screens. To keep other people from shoulder surfing (secretly peeking at your monitor screen
as you work), you can install a privacy screen, also called a privacy filter, that fits over the screen to prevent
it from being read from a wide angle. This is especially useful in tight quarters, such as on an airplane, bus,
or subway, or in other exposed locations such as a receptionist’s desk.

Using AAA for Control Access
Core 2 Objectives 2.1, 2.2
When controlling access by staff, vendors, contractors, customers, and other people to secured areas of a building
and to protected resources available on the network or Internet, three types of security measures are used: To control access to a resource, a person is first authenticated, and they are also authorized to do only certain things with
these resources. In addition, what a person attempts to do or actually does—and the time it takes to do it—can be
tracked or logged for future auditing. These three security measures are generally known as AAA (authenticating,
authorizing, and accounting) or triple A. You need to be aware of the following two principles of AAA:
●● A person is authenticated only if they are on the list. In networking, an access control list (ACL) includes
which users, devices, or programs have access to a particular resource—such as a printer, folder, or file
on a corporate network or computer. Most security measures enforce multifactor authentication (MFA),
which requires more than one factor or action to authenticate someone. Two-factor authentication (2FA)
is most often used, and the two factors normally involve what the user
■ Knows (such as a Windows or Facebook password)
■ Possesses (a token such as a key, smart card, or key fob)
■ Does (such as voice or speech recognition)
■ Is (through the use of biometric data, such as a fingerprint)
●● A person is authorized to do only what their job requires. Using the principle of least privilege, a user is
classified to determine the privileges they need to do their jobs. For example, some users need the privilege
Figure 16-7 The security plate and the tattoo beneath it
serve as an asset-management tag and theftprevention plate

●● Install a theft-prevention plate. As an added precaution, physically mark a computer case or laptop so it
can be identified if it is later stolen. You can embed a theft-prevention plate into the case and engrave or
tattoo your ID information into it. See Figure 16-7. To further help you identify stolen equipment, record
serial numbers and model numbers in a safe place separate from the equipment. This information can also
be included in an asset management system.

to sign in to a system remotely, and others do not. Generally, when a new employee begins work, that
employee’s job description, with exceptions approved by their supervisor, determine what privileges the
employee needs to perform their job. You, as the support technician, would be responsible to make sure
the user account assigned to the employee has these privileges and no more.
Hard and Soft Tokens
Tokens used to restrict who can access a secured physical location, such as entrance into a building or to a network,
might be a hard token (a physical device you possess) or a soft token (data you can retrieve):
●● Key. It may sound old-fashioned, but a simple key is a hard token that can open a locked door. In the security
world, it’s important to know who has been assigned a given key and which locks the key can open.
●● Smart card. A smart card used as a hard token has an embedded microprocessor usually installed on the
card under a small gold plate. For example, most current credit cards have a gold plate and microprocessor and are smart cards, as opposed to earlier credit cards that used only a magnetic strip with no internal
processor. The microprocessor contains information that is read by a smart card reader or badge reader
when the device is inserted into the reader or transmitted wirelessly. Refer back to Figure 16-2.
A smart card that is able to authenticate the reader is called a command access card (CAC). This mutual
authentication occurs when authentication goes in both directions at the same time and both entities confirm the identity of the other. A CAC used by the Department of Defense can include personal data such as
the user’s name, digital signature, fingerprints, photo, department, date of birth, and even medical records.
See Figure 16-8.
Because a smart card contains a microprocessor and data, it’s considered both a hard token and a soft
token.

authentication and transfer of data

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Key fob. A key fob is a token that fits
conveniently on a keychain, such as
the one shown in Figure 16-9. When
a user signs in to the network, they
must enter the number on the key
fob, which changes every 60 seconds
and is synchronized with the network authentication service. Entering the number proves that the user
has the key fob in hand. Because the
device doesn’t actually make physical contact with the system, it is
called a contactless token or disconnected token.
●● Biometrics. Biometric locks require
special input called biometric data
to identify a person via a retina scanner, fingerprint scanner, or palm
print scanner. Figure 16-10 shows a
fingerprint scanner. Many mobile devices, such
as iPads and some laptops, have fingerprint scanners built in.
●● Digital certificates. Think of a digital certificate as a digital signature that proves a person
or entity, such as a web server, is who they
say they are. It’s a small file that holds information about the identity of the person or
entity. In addition, a public encryption key is
used to prove the certificate is legitimate; it’s
similar to a notary verifying that a signature
is legitimate. The digital certificate and public
encryption key are assigned by a Certificate
Authority (CA) that has confirmed your identity in a separate process. VeriSign (verisign.
com), GlobalSign (globalsign.com), and Let’s
Encrypt (letsencrypt.org) are three well-known
CAs. You purchase a digital certificate from a
CA and then install it on your desktop, laptop,
or other computing device; in some cases, you
can install it on a smart card or flash drive that
you can use on any computer.
Digital certificates are used to authenticate individuals (such as to digitally sign and
encrypt email or to connect to a corporate
network via a VPN), software (Windows can
require that device drivers be digitally signed),
or server applications (many web servers are
digitally signed). For example, to see a web
server’s digital certificate, navigate to the
webpage in your browser, click the lock icon,
and then click Certificate. Figure 16-11 shows
information about the *.google.com certificate.

●● Authenticator apps. An authenticator app, sometimes called a
software token app, is installed on your smartphone or other
computing device to provide a counter or number generator
similar to that provided by a key fob for one factor in multifactor authentication. The app is synchronized with the same calculations on the server so the app and the server expect the
same number at the same time. Software token providers for 2FA
include Google Authenticator (google.com), Twilio Authy (authy.
com), and LastPass Authenticator (lastpass.com/auth). Many
online accounts—such as banking accounts, Facebook, Google,
and Amazon—can be set to use 2FA and software tokens. For
example, the Authy app by Twilio can be used to require 2FA to
sign in to Facebook (see Figure 16-12).
In general, to set up 2FA with an online account, you would do
the following:
1. Sign up for and configure the 2FA service with a 2FA provider
such as Twilio. You’ll need to download and install its
authenticator app to your phone or computer.
2. Enable 2FA with a Facebook, Google, banking, or other account
you want to secure.
3. Configure the account to use the 2FA service.
4. Now, each time you sign in to the account, you must
provide your password and the number generated by the
authenticator app.

Email Filtering
One more security feature that controls what someone is authorized to do on the job is email filtering. Most email
providers offer email filtering to filter out suspicious messages based on databases of known scams, spammers,
and malware. Corporations might route incoming and outgoing email through a proxy server for filtering with the
following goals in mind:
●● Incoming email is inspected for scams or spam that might trick an employee into introducing malware into
the corporate network.
●● Outgoing email from employees might be filtered for inappropriate content. This lawful interception is
intended to verify that an employee is complying with privacy laws (for example, laws that protect confidential medical records) and is not accidentally or intentionally leaking corporate data and secrets. Email
filtering software used in this way is an example of data loss prevention (DLP) software, which helps protect
against leaking corporate data.
Social Engineering and User Education
Core 2 Objectives 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 3.3
Generally speaking, people are the weakest link in setting up security in a computer environment. That’s because
people can often be tricked into giving out private information and allowing access to secure systems. Even with all
the news and hype about identity theft and criminal websites, it’s amazing how well they still work. Many users naively
download a funny screen saver, open an email attachment, or enter credit card information on a website without regard
to security. In the IT arena, social engineering is the practice of tricking people into giving out private information or
allowing unsafe programs into a network or computer.
A good support technician is aware of the criminal practices used and is able to teach users how to recognize
and avoid this mischief. Many organizations routinely offer security awareness training, also known as anti-phishing training, to its employees to help them recognize common threats and social engineering situations. In this part
of the module, you learn about several of these need-to-know practices.
Protect Passwords
It’s important for users to understand they need to protect their passwords, personally identifiable information
(PII), and other sensitive data. Train users to not send this type of data over email or carelessly leave it in sight on
a desk or printer. Always shred documents containing sensitive data before putting them in the trash. Sanitize a
device before disposing of it (you learn about ways to sanitize devices later in this module). Other ways to protect
passwords include the following:
●● Never give out your passwords to anyone, not even a supervisor or tech support person who calls and asks
for it.
●● Don’t store your passwords on a computer unless you use company-approved password vault software
(for example, KeePass or LastPass). Some organizations even forbid employees from writing down their
passwords.
●● Don’t use the same password on more than one computer, network, application, or website.
A common use of multifactor authentication (MFA) is sending a confirmation code by text to your smartphone using a
phone number the server already has on file. The problem with this method is that text messages are sent to a phone
using the short message service (SMS) protocol, which is not encrypted and can be hacked. The same goes for voice
calls used for MFA, which can also be hacked because voice is not encrypted. Rather than text or voice MFA, for better
security, use an authenticator app.

You learn more about protecting passwords in later modules.
Prevent Tailgating
Users need to be on the alert for tailgating, which is when an unauthorized person follows an employee through a secured entrance to a room
or building or continues a Windows session after the authorized user
has stepped away. To help prevent tailgating a Windows session, a user
needs to do the following:
●● Sign out of or lock the workstation. Make it a habit to sign out of
or lock the workstation when not in use. To do that in Windows,
click Start, click the account icon, and click either Sign out or
Lock. To use the keyboard shortcut to lock the workstation, press
Windows+L. See Figure 16-13. The difference between the two is
that when you sign out, all your apps are closed and your Windows session ends. When you lock the workstation, your session
stays open, and your apps continue to run until you enter your
password to continue your session.
●● Screensaver lock. After a period of inactivity, a computer normally displays a screensaver and goes into sleep mode until a
key is pressed to wake it up. A screensaver lock locks the computer before it goes to sleep and requires a password to unlock
it before restoring the user session. To configure a screensaver
lock in Windows, in the Settings app, select Accounts and then
Sign-in options. See Figure 16-14. Verify When PC wakes up from
sleep is selected.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to recognize and distinguish among examples of social engineering situations that
might compromise security, such as shoulder surfing, tailgating, dumpster diving, impersonations, phishing, whaling,
vishing, spoofing, and insider threats.
Next, we turn our attention to dealing with malware. As an IT support technician, you will most certainly be
called on to handle it.
Dealing with Malicious Software
on Personal Computers
Core 2 Objectives 1.3, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.2, 3.3
Malicious software, also called malware, is any unwanted program that is intended for harm and is transmitted
to your computer without your knowledge. Grayware is any annoying and unwanted program that might or might
not intend harm—for example, adware that produces all those unwanted pop-up ads. In this section of the module,
you learn about the different types of malware and grayware, what to do to clean up an infected system, and how
to protect a system from infection.
Common Social Engineering Techniques
Users need to be aware of these social engineering techniques and understand how to resist hackers trying to gain
access to networks, computers, and sensitive data:
●● Dumpster diving and impersonation. Dumpster diving is looking for useful information in someone’s trash
to help create a convincing impersonation of an individual or company to aid in a malicious attack. Even
something that might appear harmless, such as an organizational chart, can help a thief create a convincing
email hoax message. For best security, shred all papers and printouts before recycling, and educate users
about the importance of shredding.
●● Phishing, whaling, and vishing. Phishing (pronounced “fishing”) is a type of identity theft in which the
sender of an email hoax scams you into responding with personal data about yourself. A phishing attack
that targets a high-profile employee, such as the CEO or CFO, is called whaling. Vishing is phishing with
voice and is a phone call scam that tries to lure you into giving out personal information.
●● Spear phishing and spoofing. Even more plausible than phishing is spear phishing, where an email appears
to come from companies you already do business with. The scam artist baits you by asking you to verify
personal data on your bank account, ISP account, credit card account, or something of that nature. Often a
convincing impersonation of an individual or company tricks you into responding to the email or clicking a
link in the email message, which takes you to an official-looking site complete with corporate or bank logos,
where you are asked to enter your user ID and password to enter the site. This tactic is called spoofing,
which means the scammer makes both the email and website look like the real thing. An email message
might contain a link that leads to a malicious script. If you think an email is legitimate, be on the safe side
and don’t click the link. To keep a script from running, type the website’s home page into your browser
address bar and navigate to the relevant page on the website.
Good sites to help you debunk a virus hoax or email hoax are the following:
●● snopes.com by Snopes Media Group Inc.
●● breakthechain.org by John R. Ratliff
●● securelist.com by Kaspersky Lab
Don’t forward an email hoax. If you get a hoax from a person you know, do us all a favor and send that person
some of the preceding links!

What Are We Up Against?
Core 2 Objective 2.3
You need to know your enemy! According to metadata from anti-malware developers, more than 560,000 new malware
programs are detected daily. Different categories of malware and scamming techniques are listed next:
●● Viruses. A virus is a program that replicates by attaching itself to other programs. The infected program
must be executed for a virus to run. The program might be an application, a macro in a document, a Windows
system file, or a boot loader program.
●● Spyware. Spyware spies on you to collect personal information that it transmits over the Internet to webhosting sites. An example of spyware is a keylogger that tracks all your keystrokes and can be used to steal
your identity, credit card numbers, Social Security number, bank information, passwords, email addresses,
and so forth.
●● Worms. A worm is a program that copies itself throughout a network or the Internet without a host program.
A worm creates problems by overloading the network as it replicates and can even hijack or install a server
program such as a web server.
●● Trojans. A Trojan does not need a host program to work; rather, it substitutes itself for a legitimate program. In most cases, a user launches it thinking they are launching a legitimate program. A Trojan is often
embedded in the files of legitimate software that is downloaded from an untrustworthy website, or a user
is tricked into opening an email attachment (see Figure 16-15).
Figure 16-15 By opening this email attachment, a user is likely to introduce a Trojan
into the system
●● Rootkits. A rootkit loads itself before the OS boot is complete. It can hide in boot managers, boot loader programs, or kernel mode device drivers. UEFI secure boot is especially designed to catch rootkits that launch
during the boot. Because a rootkit is already loaded when most anti-malware software loads, it is sometimes
overlooked by the software. A rootkit can hide folders that contain software it has installed, cause Windows
Task Manager to display a different name for its process, hide registry keys, and can operate in user mode
or kernel mode. This last trick helps it remain undetected (see Figure 16-16).

●● Boot sector virus. A boot sector virus infects the first sector on a MBR (Master Boot Record) hard drive
and can infect the partition table in that sector. The virus works by replacing the program in the first sector,
which is used to boot the system. The infection usually happens when you boot a computer with bootable
media, such as a USB flash drive, that is infected. To remove a boot sector virus, you’ll need antivirus software that runs in a preinstallation environment before the OS launches. Boot sector viruses are not as common as they once were because hard drives use the newer GPT partitioning system rather than the more
vulnerable MBR system and also because modern BIOS/UEFI is designed to detect and stop these viruses.

Caution
If anti-malware software reports that a rootkit is present but cannot delete it, the best solution is to immediately disconnect the computer from the network (if you have not already done so), back up your important data, format your
hard drive, and reinstall the OS.
Although malicious software is designed to do varying degrees of damage to data and software, it does not damage
computer hardware. However, when partition table information is destroyed on a hard drive, the drive can appear to
be physically damaged.
Note 3
●● Ransomware. Ransomware holds your computer system hostage until you pay money. For example, the
infamous CryptoLocker Trojan program was embedded in email attachments and was known to work
on Windows, Android, and even some iOS systems. When the user clicked the attachment, the program
encrypted the computer’s personal files. If the user didn’t pay within a 24-hour period, all the files were lost.
Many users who did not have backups of their data chose to pay the ransom. A computer infected with ransomware can infect all computers on the network and even cloud servers to which the computer connects.
A rootkit running in user mode intercepts the API calls between the time the API retrieves the data and
when it is displayed in a window. A rootkit running in kernel mode actually interferes with the Windows
kernel and substitutes its own information in place of the raw data read by the Windows kernel. Because
most anti-malware software to one degree or another relies on operating system tools and components to
work, the rootkit is not detected or cannot be deleted if the OS tools themselves are infected.

●● On-path attack. In an on-path attack, also called a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker intercepts
communication between two parties and reads and/or alters the content of messages. The attacker can
impersonate a legitimate website, network, FTP site, or person in a chat session. For example, a user might
connect to a fraudulent Wi-Fi hotspot, called an evil twin, thinking it’s a legitimate hotspot, and attempt
to start a chat session with a business associate. The attacker pretends to be the business associate and
continues the chat with the intention of obtaining private information. The best protection against on-path
attacks is to use digital certificates to identify a person or service before transmitting sensitive information. Sometimes an evil twin hotspot exists only to steal passwords. When connecting to a public hotspot,
especially one that requires signing in, be sure the hotspot is legitimate.
●● Zero-day attack. A zero-day attack can happen in two ways: A hacker discovers a security hole in software
that is unknown to the developer of the software, or a hacker takes advantage of a recently reported gap
in software security before users apply patches released by the developer. The race is on for the vendor to
provide a patch to the software and for users to apply those patches before hackers have even one day to
use the hole to infect systems and steal user data. Microsoft normally publishes security patches on the
second Tuesday of each month (known as patch Tuesday), but sometimes releases patches off schedule so
hackers have less time to attack customers.
●● Denial of service. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack overwhelms a computer or network with requests or traffic until new connections can no longer be accepted. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack happens
when multiple computers are involved in the attack. As shown in Figure 16-17, DDoS attacks are sometimes
performed by zombies and botnets, which are described next.
Caution
The best defense against ransomware is to keep backups of data file versions in a location that is not accessible from
Windows File Explorer or macOS Finder. A ransomware attack can infect any storage device connected or mapped to your
computer, and a single layer of data file backups might be replaced with the encrypted files before you’re able to clean
your computer and restore the backed-up data. Use a backup method that retains multiple file versions (indefinitely, if
possible) and that is not directly accessible from your computer. Many cloud backup services meet these requirements,
such as Carbonite (carbonite.com), Backblaze (backblaze.com), and IDrive (idrive.com). After a ransomware attack, you can
wipe the computer, reinstall software from original sources, and restore unaffected file versions from your online backups.

What Makes Us the Most Vulnerable?
Core 2 Objective 2.4
Listed next are some reasons systems are the most vulnerable to attacks:
●● Noncompliant systems. A system administrator needs techniques in place to routinely scan BYOD and corporate-owned smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and servers for noncompliant systems that violate
security best practices, such as an OS that is not kept updated or anti-malware software that is not up to date
or not even installed. One software suite of products designed to manage user devices in an organization is
Microsoft Endpoint Manager. One component of this suite is Configuration Manager, which can scan devices
for noncompliance. BYODs are particularly susceptible to noncompliance because a corporation generally
has less control over a user-owned device than one owned by the corporation and assigned to the user.
●● Unprotected and unpatched systems. Personal devices that are not managed by a corporation are especially
vulnerable when the OS is not kept up to date with all available patches and anti-malware is not running in
real time or kept up to date. For a workstation or laptop system, it’s also important that firewalls are set for
maximum protection, especially when the computer is connected to a public network.
●● End-of-life OS. If the OS has reached the end of its life cycle, the developer no longer provides security
patches, making the OS vulnerable to attack. It’s time to upgrade the OS to a current edition.
●● Structured Query Language (SQL) injections. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a popular scripting
and programming language designed primarily to query databases. SQL programmers can carelessly create vulnerabilities in their software, making it possible for hackers to inject their own code in a query to
the database and retrieve data they are not authorized to access. An SQL injection happens when part of a
user’s typed text is used to construct a query, and a hacker familiar with SQL uses text that actually changes
the query (see Figure 16-18). The programmer can prevent SQL injections by creating queries that only use
prepared text rather than untrusted user text. Another solution is to allow untrusted text in a query only if
the text can be found in a whitelist of approved text.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to identify, detect, remove, or prevent viruses, Trojans,
spyware, keyloggers, ransomware, rootkits, boot sector viruses, on-path attacks, zero-day attacks, DoS/DDoS attacks,
crypto mining software, and dictionary attacks.
●● Zombies and botnets. A zombie is a computer that has been hacked, and the hacker is using the computer
to run repetitive software in the background without the knowledge of its user. For example, the zombie
might be email spamming or performing DDoS attacks. A hacker might build an entire network of zombies,
which is called a botnet (a network of robots). The CryptoLocker Trojan program was distributed by a botnet and ultimately isolated when the botnet was taken down. Cryptojacking is a type of zombie attack that
installs crypto mining software to run mining operations. Crypto miner software validates cryptocurrency
transactions, and these transactions are linked to the ongoing chains of transactions called blockchains.
●● Dictionary attack. A dictionary attack can be used to crack a password by trying words in a dictionary.
Password cracker software might combine a brute force attack (systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols) with a dictionary attack to guess the password. A dictionary
attack is usually more efficient than using brute force.
●● Rainbow tables. A rainbow table contains a long list of plaintext passwords, just as users would enter, and
the password hash list (after it is encrypted). Organizations store only hashed passwords and not plaintext
passwords. When hackers obtain a stolen list of hashed passwords, they can compare this list with those
in their rainbow tables to find a match. When two hashed passwords match, they can use the plaintext
password in the rainbow table to sign in to the system, impersonating the user.
Rainbow tables make cracking passwords faster than dictionary cracking or brute force cracking. The
best defenses against rainbow table attacks are for an organization to use the very best hashing techniques
to encrypt their passwords and to add extra characters to the password hash (called salting the passwords).

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Cross-site scripting (XSS). Cross-site scripting (XSS) happens when an attacker sends a malicious script to
an online application, and the application unknowingly sends the script to an unsuspecting user’s browser,
which executes the script under the user’s credentials. See Figure 16-19. This script might instruct the online
app to send sensitive data to the hacker or even give the hacker control of the app. An online app is vulnerable to this type of injection attack if the app’s developer does not carefully test each data entry point in
the app to ensure that scripts cannot be accepted as user input.

SQL and HTML scripts are vulnerable to injection attacks because the scripts can be a combination of text and commands, and text can be interpreted as commands by simply inserting a few key characters in the right place. You learn
more about scripting in the module, “Linux and Scripting.”
Note 4
●● Insider threats. Employees and others who have legitimate access to the network and data can be a threat
if they are careless or negligent and accidentally leak data or fall victim to a social engineering attack.
In addition, malicious insiders might intentionally steal data or do other damage.
●● Lack of user education. Cybint (cybintsolutions.com) reports that 95% of online attacks are caused by human
error. Lack of user education about how to avoid attacks makes systems especially vulnerable.
Step-By-Step Attack Plan
Core 2 Objective 3.3
This section provides a step-by-step attack plan to clean up an infected system. We use anti-malware software,
also called antivirus software, to remove all types of general malware, including viruses, spyware, worms, and
rootkits. Then we’ll use some Windows tools to check out the system, making sure all remnants of malware have
been removed and the system is in tip-top order.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Step 1: Identifying and Researching Malware Symptoms
Core 2 Objectives 1.3, 3.2, 3.3
An IT support technician needs to know how to recognize that a system is infected. Here are some warnings that
suggest malicious software is at work:
●● Pop-up ads, browser redirection, and desktop alerts. Basically, a user is losing control of their system. Pop-up
ads (see Figure 16-20) are randomly appearing and the browser home page has changed. A browser might also
have an uninvited toolbar. The user enters the URL for one website and another site appears in the browser
window. Security alerts—real or spoofed—regularly appear on the desktop to interrupt the user’s activity.
Caution
If a system is highly infected and will later hold sensitive data, a fresh start might be in order. In fact, Microsoft recommends reinstalling Windows as the safest way to deal with highly infected systems. If you have recent backups of data,
format the hard drive, reinstall or reimage Windows, and restore data from backups.
If you don’t have recent backups for a Windows 10/11 system, you can try a repair installation or a Windows reset
without losing user data. In the module, “Troubleshooting Windows Startup,” you learned about all of these options to
reinstall Windows.
As you work your way through the steps described next to remediate an infected system, at any point in the process, you might realize the system is highly infected and the best course of action is to stop remediating the system
and to simply reinstall the OS.
Figure 16-20 Random and frequent pop-up ads indicate malware
●● Unable to access the network or the Internet, application crashes, and OS update failures. These types
of problems seem to plague the system with no reasonable explanation that is specific to the network,
application, or Windows update.
●● Rogue antivirus software and false alerts. You see false alerts from software that claims to be antivirus
software protecting your system. When the user tries to run Microsoft Defender Antivirus (anti-malware
software embedded in Windows 10/11), it refuses to run. In the Windows Security window, you find that
Defender Antivirus has been disabled because other antivirus software the user did not install is running. Source: Forbes

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Strange notifications and slow performance. Generally, the system works much slower than before.
Programs take longer than normal to load. Strange or bizarre error messages appear. Programs that once
worked now give errors. Task Manager shows unfamiliar processes running. The computer’s operating
system might lock up.
●● Problems with files. Personal files now have weird names or their file sizes seem excessively large.
Executable files have changed size or file extensions change without reason. Files mysteriously disappear
or appear. Windows system files are renamed. Files constantly become corrupted. Files you could once
access now give access-denied messages, and file permissions change.
●● Problems updating your anti-malware software. Even though you can browse to other websites, you cannot access anti-malware software sites such as symantec.com or mcafee.com, and you cannot update your
anti-malware software.
●● Certificate warnings. An OS is responsible for validating certificates used to secure communication.
For Windows, Microsoft maintains a database of trusted root certificates issued by Certificate Authorities
(CAs). A root certificate is the original certificate issued by the CA. When a Windows system opens a secure
email or visits a secure website and encounters a new digital certificate, it requests Microsoft’s trusted root
certificate, which is downloaded to the computer. The download happens seamlessly without the user’s
knowledge unless there’s a problem. If Windows cannot obtain the root certificate to validate the email or
website, it displays an error (see Figure 16-21). Don’t trust websites or email whose certificates have expired
or have been revoked.
Windows allows only one anti-malware product to run at a time. You can use Task Manager to stop the rogue antivirus
software and then start Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
Note 5
If a computer gives certificate warnings, check that the Windows date is correct. A wrong Windows date before the
certificate was issued can cause the problem.

Step 2: Quarantining an Infected System
Core 2 Objective 3.3
If an infected computer is connected to a wired or wireless network, immediately disconnect the network cable
or turn off the wireless adapter. You don’t want to spread a virus or worm to other computers on your network. A
quarantined computer is not allowed to use the regular network that other computers use. If you need to use the
Internet to download anti-malware software or its updates, take some precautions first. Consider your options. Can
you disconnect other computers from the network while the infected computer is connected? Can you isolate the
computer from your local network and connect it directly to the ISP or a special quarantined network? If neither
option is possible, try downloading the anti-malware software updates while the computer is booted into Safe Mode
with Networking or after a clean boot. (Safe Mode doesn’t always allow downloads.) Malware might still be running
in Safe Mode or after a clean boot, but it’s less likely to do so than when the system is started normally.
Always keep in mind that data on the hard drive might not be backed up. Before you begin cleaning up the system, back up data to another media.
Step 3: Disabling System Protection
Core 2 Objective 3.3
In Windows, some malware hides its program files in restore points stored in the System Volume Information
folder that’s maintained by System Protection. If System Protection is on, anti-malware software can’t clean this
You can use the Certificate Manager (certmgr.msc) in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to view and
delete root certificates, as shown in Figure 16-22. For example, the Superfish virus injects a rogue root certificate
into the Microsoft store of trusted certificates on the local computer so it can perform an in-path attack to display
adware on secure websites a user visits. If you see a Superfish certificate listed among trusted root certificates, be
sure to delete it.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to recognize the common symptoms of malware listed
previously and to know how to quarantine and remediate an infected system.

store of trusted certificates

protected folder. To get rid of the malware, turn off System Protection so anti-malware software can clean the System Volume
Information folder (see Figure 16-23). Realize that when you
turn off System Protection, all your restore points are lost, so
first consider whether you might need those restore points to
troubleshoot the malware infection before you disable System
Protection. Also consider that a restore point might be infected
and, when applied, might reintroduce the malware back into
the system.
To turn off System Protection, right-click Start, click System,
and in the About window, click System protection. Later, when
you are sure the system is clean, turn System Protection back
on, and create a new restore point that you can use in the future
if problems arise.
Caution
Some highly infected systems will not allow anti-malware software to run. In this situation, you can boot the computer
into Safe Mode and use System Restore to apply a restore point that was taken before the infection. Applying a restore
point cannot be counted on to completely remove an infection, but it might remove startup entries the malware is
using, making it possible to run the anti-malware software from the normal Windows desktop or to run the software in
Safe Mode. Consider that you might need to apply a restore point before you disable System Protection, which deletes
all your restore points.
Step 4: Remediating the Infected System
Core 2 Objectives 2.5, 3.3
Microsoft Defender Antivirus software is embedded in Windows 10/11 and activated by default. Table 16-1 lists other
popular anti-malware software for personal computers and their websites, which also provide information about
malware. Before selecting a product, be sure to read some reviews about it and check out some reliable websites
that rate anti-malware software. Don’t make the mistake of using an infected computer to purchase and download
anti-malware software because keyloggers might be spying and collecting credit card information.

Now let’s look at different situations you might encounter when attempting to run anti-malware software.
Update and Run Anti-Malware Software
Anti-malware software can’t find what it doesn’t know to look for. As new malware gets into the wild (becomes available on the Internet), anti-malware software needs to be updated with these latest malware definitions, also called
malware signatures. Do the following to update and run the software:
1. Verify the anti-malware software is up to date. Microsoft Defender Antivirus normally gets its updates
in Windows security updates. To manually check for updates for Windows 10 Defender Antivirus, in
Settings, open Update & Security, click Windows Security, and click Virus & threat protection. In
the Virus & threat protection window (see Figure 16-25), click Check for updates. For Windows 11, in
Settings, click Privacy & security, Windows Security, Virus & threat protection, Protection updates,
and Check for updates. If you are using third-party anti-malware, open the app and look for the update
feature in the app’s window.
Caution
Beware of websites that appear as sponsored links at the top of search results for anti-malware software. These sites
might appear to be the home site for the software, but they are really trying to lure you into downloading adware or
spyware.

2. Use the anti-malware software to perform a full scan of the system. For example, for Defender Antivirus,
in the Virus & threat protection window (see Figure 16-25), click Scan options. In the Scan options window
(see Figure 16-26), select Full scan and click Scan now. As it scans, the software might ask you what to
do with an infected program (see Figure 16-27), or it might log the event in an event viewer or history log
it keeps. In most situations, you would delete an infected program.

If you ever encounter a virus that your updated anti-malware software did not find, be sure to let the manufacturer of
the software know so they can research the problem.
Note 7
3. After the scan is complete and you have decided what to do with each suspicious file, reboot the
system, allow the software to update itself again, and then scan the system again. Most likely, some new
malware will be discovered. Keep rebooting and rescanning until a scan comes up clean.
Figure 16-26 A full scan can take some time and is preferred
when a virus is suspected
When Anti-Malware Software Gives Errors
If Defender Antivirus detects malware it cannot remove, it asks permission to run Microsoft Defender Offline. When
you agree, the system reboots and runs a scan in the recovery environment (preinstallation environment). Defender
Offline can detect and remove rootkits, boot sector viruses, and other persistent malware that cannot be dealt with

Figure 16-27 It is better to remove a threat rather than
quarantine or allow it
after Windows starts. If Defender Antivirus or third-party anti-malware software refuses to run or runs with errors,
follow these steps:
1. Perform a Microsoft Defender Offline scan. Sign in to Windows using an administrator account. In the
Scan options window (refer back to Figure 16-26), select Microsoft Defender Offline scan, and click
Scan now. Respond to the UAC dialog box. The computer reboots in the preinstallation environment and
scans the system.
2. Boot into Safe Mode and scan the system. Some malware prevents anti-malware software from running.
In this situation, try booting the system in Safe Mode or performing a clean boot and then running the
anti-malware software. Recall that to launch Windows in Safe Mode, also called Safe boot, enter the
msconfig command in the Windows search box. In the System Configuration dialog box, click the Boot
tab and check Safe boot (see Figure 16-28). To launch Safe Mode with Networking so you can update
your anti-malware software, select Network in the list of options. Then restart the system.

searching for suspicious entries in the Windows registry subkeys under HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\
SafeBoot. Subkeys under this key control what is launched when you boot into Safe Mode. How to edit the registry is
covered in the module “Troubleshooting Windows After Startup.”
Note 8
3. Scan the system using a healthy networked computer. Follow these steps:
a. On the infected computer, share drive C: so you can reach it from another computer.
b. Make sure the remote computer has its software firewall set for maximum protection and its installed
anti-malware software is up to date and running.
c. Network the two computers. (Don’t connect the infected computer to the entire network. If
necessary, you can connect the two computers using a crossover cable or using a small switch and
network cables.)
d. To make your work easier, you can map a network drive from the remote computer to drive C: on the
infected computer.
e. Perform an anti-malware scan on the remote computer, pointing the scan to drive C: on the infected
computer. For Defender Antivirus, open the Scan options window (refer back to Figure 16-26), select
Custom scan, click Scan now, and point to the infected computer under Network.
How to network two computers with a switch and cables is covered in the Core 1 module, “Networking Fundamentals.”
How to share a drive or folder and how to mount a network drive are covered in the module, “Securing and Sharing
Windows Resources.”

When an Infected Computer Will Not Boot
If an infected computer will not boot, the boot manager, boot loaders, or kernel mode drivers launched at startup
might be infected or damaged. Launch the computer into Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), and use
the Startup Repair process to repair the system. The module “Troubleshooting Windows Startup” gives more information about solving boot problems. You can also install the hard drive as a second drive in another system and
use that system to scan the drive for malware.
Some anti-malware companies offer preinstallation scanning tools, also called rescue disks or bootable antivirus tools.
One example is Kaspersky’s Rescue Disk (kaspersky.com), which is free. You learn how to use the disk in a project at the
end of this module.
Note 10
Figure 16-29 The malware downloader dnsatlantic.exe is still running after multiple scans of antimalware software
Run More Than One Scan of Anti-Malware Software
After you’ve scanned the system using one of the methods just discussed, reboot, update the software, and then
keep scanning and rebooting until the scan report is clean. If a second or third scan doesn’t remove all symptoms of
malware, consider installing and running a second anti-malware program. What one anti-malware program cannot
detect or remove, another one might. For example, Defender Antivirus on one system removed malware it detected,

In this situation, try another anti-malware program. For example, Microsoft Safety Scanner (docs.microsoft.com/
en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/safety-scanner-download) is not designed for ongoing malware
prevention but can sometimes remove malware that Defender Antivirus did not find. Download and run the latest
version of the software.
Clean Up What’s Left Over
Next, you’ll need to clean up anything the anti-malware software left behind. Sometimes anti-malware software tells
you it is not able to delete a file, or it deletes an infected file but leaves behind an orphaned entry in the registry
or startup folders. If the anti-malware software tells you it was not able to delete or clean a file, first check the antimalware software website for any instructions you might find to manually clean things up. Here are some general
actions you can take to clean up what the software left behind:
1. Respond to any startup errors. On the first boot after anti-malware software has declared a system
clean, you might still find some startup errors caused by incomplete removal of the malware. Use Task
Manager to find out how a startup program is launched. If the program is launched from the registry, you
can back up and delete the registry key. If the program is launched from a startup folder, you can move
or delete the shortcut or program in the folder. See the appendix “Entry Points for Windows Startup
Processes” for a list of startup folders and startup registry keys.
2. Research malware types and program files. Your anti-malware software might alert you to a suspicious
program file that it quarantines and then ask you to decide if you want to delete it. The web is your
best tool to use when making your decision about a program. Some websites that offer malware
encyclopedias that are reliable and give you symptoms and solutions for malware include the following:
●● Process Library by ProcessLibrary at processlibrary.com
●● DLL Library by Uniblue Systems Limited at liutilities.com
●● All the anti-malware software sites listed earlier in Table 16-1
Beware of using other sites! Much information on the web is written by people who are just
guessing, and some of the information is put there to purposefully deceive. Check things out carefully,
and learn which sites you can rely on.
3. Delete files. For each program file the anti-malware software told you it could not delete, delete the
program file yourself by following these steps:
a. First try Explorer to locate a file and delete it. For peace of mind, don’t forget to empty the Recycle
Bin when you’re done.
b. If the file is hidden or access is denied, open an elevated command prompt window and use the
commands listed in Table 16-2 to take control of a file so you can delete it. If the commands don’t
work using an elevated command prompt window, use the commands in a command prompt window
in Windows RE.
c. To get rid of other malware files, use the Disk Cleanup process in the Drive C: properties dialog box,
or delete the browsing history using the Internet Options dialog box.
d. Delete all subfolders and files in the C:\Windows\Temp folder, which Trojan downloaders are likely to use.
Command Description
attrib –r –s filename.ext Remove the read-only and system attributes to a file.
tasklist | more
taskkill /f /pid:9999
To stop a running process, first use the tasklist command to find out
the process ID for the process. Then use the taskkill command to
forcefully kill the process with the given process ID.
takeown /f filename.ext Take ownership of a file.
icacls filename.ext /grant administrators:f Take full access of a file.

4. Clean up your browsers and uninstall unwanted programs. Adware and spyware might install add-ons
to a browser (including toolbars you didn’t ask for), install cookie trackers, and change your browser
security settings. Anti-malware software might have found all these items, but as a good defense, take a
few minutes to find out for yourself. The module “Network Security and Troubleshooting” covers how to
use the Internet Options dialog box to search for unwanted add-ons and delete ActiveX controls. You can
uninstall unwanted toolbars, plug-ins, and other software using the Programs and Features window.
Step 5: Protecting the System with Scheduled Scans and Updates
Core 2 Objective 3.3
Once your system is clean, you’ll certainly want to keep it that way. The following are three best practices to protect
a system against malware:
●● Use anti-malware software. Microsoft Defender Antivirus is enabled and automatically updated by default.
If you decide to use other anti-malware software, configure the software so it (1) runs in the background in
real time to alert users of malware that attempts to run or install, (2) automatically scans incoming email
attachments, and (3) performs scheduled scans of the system and automatically downloads updates to the
software.
●● Always use a software firewall. Never, ever connect your computer to an unprotected network without
using a firewall. Windows Defender Firewall is turned on by default. Recall that you can configure Windows
Defender Firewall to allow no uninvited communication or to allow the exceptions that you specify. Details
about Windows Defender Firewall are covered in the module “Network Security and Troubleshooting.”
●● Keep Windows updates current. Microsoft continually releases updates to plug vulnerable entrances
in Windows where malware might attack and updates to Defender Antivirus. Recall that you can verify
Windows Update settings in the Settings app.
Step 6: Enabling System Protection and Creating a Restore Point
Core 2 Objective 3.3
Now that the system is clean, you can turn System Protection back on if necessary and create a restore point. You
learned how to do this in the module “Maintaining Windows.”
Step 7: Educating the End User
Core 2 Objectives 2.3, 3.3
Now would be a good time to sit down with the user and go over the tips presented earlier in this module to keep
the system free from malware. Sometimes the most overlooked step in preventing malware infections is to educate
the user. Even with all your security measures in place, a user can still download and execute a Trojan, which can
install more malware in the system.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to perform one or more of the seven steps to remove
malware. Memorize these seven steps and know how to use them in the correct order.
Now we turn our attention to other ways an IT technician might be called on to protect data and other resources,
including enforcing licensing and security policies and protecting regulated data.

Licensing, Regulated Data, and
Security Policies
Core 2 Objectives 2.6, 2.8, 4.1, 4.6
An IT technician is expected to follow company security policies for software licensing and regulated data. You also
need to know what to do if you discover that these policies have been violated.
Software Licensing and Digital Rights
Core 2 Objective 4.6
As an IT support technician, you need to be especially aware of the issues surrounding software licensing. When
someone purchases software from a software developer, that person or organization has only purchased a license
for the software, which is the right to use it. The buyer does not legally own the software and therefore does not
have the right to distribute it. Important facts about software licensing include the following:
●● The copyright. The right to copy the work, called a copyright, belongs to the creator of the work or others
to whom the creator transfers this right. Copyrights are intended to legally protect the intellectual property
rights of organizations or individuals to creative works, which include books, images, and software.
●● The EULA. Your rights to use or copy software are clearly stated in the End User License Agreement (EULA) that
you agree to when you install the software (see Figure 16-30). The EULA is a legally binding contract between the
user and software owner. If the user violates the agreement, the software license is no longer valid. A non-expiring
software license does not require renewing, or the license might be valid only for a period of time.
●● Software piracy. Making unauthorized copies of original software violates the Federal Copyright Act of 1976
and is called software piracy or, more officially, software copyright infringement. (This act allows for one
backup copy of software to be made.) Making a copy of software and then selling it or giving it away is a
violation of the law. Normally, only the employee who violates the copyright law is liable for infringement;
however, in some cases, an employer or supervisor is also held responsible, even when the copies were
made without the employer’s knowledge.

software installs

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
When an individual or organization purchases the right to install one instance of software, the license is called a
personal use license. By purchasing a site license, also called a commercial use license, a company can obtain
the right to multiple installations of software.
Note 11
An IT technician needs to know their organization’s data retention policy for regulated data, which can include the
number of years regulated data must be retained after a termination date.
Note 12
●● Digital rights management. Many software companies, including Microsoft, have implemented measures to control the use of their software, a practice called digital rights management (DRM). For
example, recall that the retail release of Windows 10/11 requires a valid product key or a digital license
for activation, and Microsoft carefully verifies and monitors that this product key is used only in one
installation.
●● Open-source license. As you have learned, open-source software (such as Linux OS and Apache web
server) is developed in a public, collaborative way and can be used for any purpose. Closed-source software
(such as Windows or PhotoShop) is owned by the creator (developer). When you download open-source
software, you must agree to a EULA that describes how you can use the software and receive an open-source
license. Two popular types of open-source licenses are
■ Copyleft. A copyleft open-source license allows you to use the software for free, but you cannot sell it
or sell modified versions of it to others.
■ Permissive. With a permissive open-source license, anything goes. You can use it for free, modify it,
and sell it.
Regulated Data and Compliance Policies
Core 2 Objectives 2.6, 4.6
Certain types of data are protected by special governmental regulations and are called regulated data; this data
must be provided to the regulatory agency on demand. In addition, each industry must comply with a variety of
regulations, policies, and laws, which are collectively called regulatory and compliance policies. For example, in the
healthcare industry, patient data is highly regulated, and most hospitals employ one or more regulatory and compliance officers to ensure that the hospital is compliant. Other areas of regulation include copyright laws regulated by
the U.S. Copyright Office, workplace safety regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),
and consumer protection regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Many of these policies directly affect
IT operations. When you’re first hired by a company, you should receive training on how these issues affect your
work and what is expected of you.
Let’s look at some specific types of regulated data:
●● Personal identity. PII (personally identifiable information) is a legal term to describe data that can uniquely
identify a person, including a Social Security number, email address, physical address, birthdate, birthplace,
mother’s maiden name, marital status, phone numbers, race, and biometric data. Some PII is more sensitive
than other information and should be protected more vigilantly.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● Healthcare data. PHI (protected health information) includes any data about a person’s health status or
health care. This data is protected by regulations defined by HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act), passed in 1996. HIPAA gives patients the rights to monitor and restrict the sharing of
their medical information. Hospitals, medical personnel, and other entities covered by HIPAA regulations
risk steep penalties for privacy breaches.
●● Credit card data. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards were defined to help prevent credit card
fraud and are backed by all the major credit card brands (Visa, MasterCard, and others). PCI standards
apply to how credit card data is protected in transit (such as when receiving payments) and at rest (when
stored, such as when keeping records for recurring billing) by vendors, retailers, and financial institutions.
●● Personal government-issued information. Documents—including a birth certificate, Social Security card,
state-issued driver’s license, military ID card, or passport—and biometric data—such as fingerprints—that
a government creates or collects to identify a person is regulated in how it can be collected, stored, and
shared and how individuals must be noticed if their data is hacked. You also need to know that the GDPR
(General Data Protection Regulation) is a group of regulations implemented in 2018 in the European Union
(EU) to protect personal data of EU citizens.
Data Destruction and Disposal
Core 2 Objective 2.8
As an IT technician, you might be asked to properly dispose of storage media. In addition to the risks posed by
dumpster diving, consider its potential impact. Before you throw out a hard drive, flash drive, CD, DVD, tape, or
other media that might have regulated or corporate data on it, completely destroy the data on the device. Trying
to wipe a drive clean by deleting files or even formatting the drive does not completely destroy the data. Here are
some ways to destroy printed documents and sanitize storage devices:
●● Overwrite data on the drive. A drive needs to be wiped clean before you recycle or repurpose it. Today’s
devices receive a low-level format at the factory, which writes sector marks on a drive. (This is different
from a standard format in Windows that configures a file system on the drive.) Today’s hard drives cannot
be low-level formatted by users. However, users can erase or wipe clean a drive using a zero-fill utility that
overwrites all data on the drive with zeroes; sometimes this is inaccurately called a low-level format. You
can download a zero-fill utility or so-called low-level format utility from many hard drive manufacturers’
websites. This method works for most low-security situations, but professional thieves know how to break
through it. If you use one of these utilities, run it multiple times to write zeroes on top of zeroes. Data recovery has been known to reach 14 levels of overwrites because each bit is slightly offset from the one under it.
Organizations and individuals who have access to regulated data are at risk legally and financially if they do not comply
with the legal requirements regarding the security of this data. When you work in an organization that handles regulated
data, ensure your own protection by making certain you understand and comply with all laws regarding this data.
Note 13
An app called a file shredder can permanently delete an individual file or folder by overwriting it multiple times. Check
the reviews before downloading and using one of these apps.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
●● For solid-state devices, use a Secure Erase utility. As required by government regulations for personal data
privacy, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) developed the ATA Secure Erase standards to
wipe clean a solid-state device such as a USB flash drive or SSD. You can download a Secure Erase utility
from the manufacturer of the device and run it to sanitize the drive, or you can securely erase all data on
the device and then reuse or dispose of it.
●● Physically destroy the storage media. Use a drill to drill many holes all the way through the drive housing. Break CDs and DVDs in half, and do similar physical damage with a hammer to flash drives or tapes,
even to the point of setting them on fire to
incinerate them. Again, expert thieves can
still recover some of the data.
●● For magnetic devices, use a degausser. A
degausser exposes a storage device to a
strong electromagnetic field to completely
erase the data on a magnetic hard drive or
tape drive (see Figure 16-31). A degaussed
drive can’t be recycled, but for the best
destruction, use the degausser and physically destroy the drive. Degaussing does
not erase data on a solid-state hard drive
or other flash media because these devices
don’t use magnetic surfaces to hold data.
●● Use a shredder. You can use a paper
shredder to destroy all documents that
contain sensitive data. The best paper
shredders apply multiple passes to crosscut the paper instead of strip-cutting; this
cuts the paper into smaller pieces that
can’t be easily reassembled. Many paper
shredders can handle credit cards or
thin cardboard. Multimedia shredders
can also destroy optical discs. Disk drive
shredders, such as the one from Whitaker
Brothers (whitakerbrothers.com) shown in
Figure 16-32, can destroy magnetic hard

drives, solid-state drives, flash drives, optical discs, and even mobile devices such as smartphones or
small tablets.
●● Use a secure third-party data-destruction vendor. For the very best data destruction, consider a secure
data-destruction service. To find a vendor providing the service, search the web for “secure data destruction.” However, don’t use a service unless you have thoroughly checked its references and guarantees of
legal compliance that your organization is required to meet. The service should provide you with a digital
certificate of destruction, which verifies that the data has been destroyed beyond recovery. Paper certificates can be forged, but digital certificates produced by the software that performs the destruction will
provide auditable results of the destruction process.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam might give you a scenario that requires you to implement data-destruction techniques, including
using a shredder, degausser, incineration, drill, hammer, and recycling or repurposing techniques (low-level formats,
overwriting, and drive wipes).
Incident Response for Prohibited Content and Activities
Core 2 Objectives 4.1, 4.6
As you know, employees in an organization are often asked to agree to an acceptable use policy (AUP) that documents a code of conduct when using corporate resources. For example, the AUP may prohibit an employee from
accessing pornographic material on company computers, using company computers and time for personal shopping,
or installing pirated software on these computers.
An incident is when an employee or other person has negatively affected safety or corporate resources, violated the code of conduct for the organization, or committed a crime. When you start a new job, ask your employer
what procedures you follow for an incident response. If you’re the first person to discover an incident, such as the
intentional misuse of regulated data or other activities, you’re responsible to perform certain first response duties.
One of these tasks is to document what happened in an incident report. This report is important to prevent future
incidents and crucial to a criminal investigation. Here are some things you need to know:
●● Identify and go through proper channels. When you identify what you believe to be an infringement of
the law or the company’s code of conduct, where do you turn to report the issue? To management and/or
to law enforcement? Make sure you go only through proper channels; don’t spread rumors or accusations.
●● Preserve data and devices. What data or device should you immediately preserve as evidence for what
you believe has happened? For example, if you believe you have witnessed a customer or employee using a
company computer for a crime, should you remove and secure the hard drive from the computer, or should
you remove and secure the entire computer? Are you expected to make a copy of the data or image the hard
drive before you turn the device over to others?
●● Incident documentation. Incident documentation, also called an incident report, surrounding the evidence of an incident is important to prevent future incidents and crucial to a criminal investigation. What
documentation are you expected to submit and to whom is it submitted? This documentation might track
the chain of custody (CoC) for the evidence, which includes exactly what, when, and from whom it was collected, the condition of this evidence, and how the evidence was secured while it was in your possession.
Each device or item includes a paper trail of each person to whom the evidence has been passed on and
when. For example, suppose you suspect that a criminal act has happened and you hold a flash drive that
you believe contains evidence of this crime. You need to carefully document exactly when and how you
received the flash drive. Also, don’t pass it on to someone else in your organization unless you have the

Module Summary
Physical and Logical Security
●● Physical security can include security fences, bollards, access control vestibules, guards, video surveillance, alarm systems, magnetometers (metal detectors), locks and keys, port locks, privacy screens, and
theft-prevention plates.
●● Staff access to resources is controlled by AAA (authenticating, authorizing, and accounting) measures,
including an access control list, multifactor authentication, the principle of least privilege, hard and soft
tokens, smart cards, key fobs, biometric locks, digital certificates, authenticator apps, and email filtering.
●● Users should be trained to detect and resist social engineering, including shoulder surfing, tailgating, dumpster diving, impersonation, phishing, email hoaxes, whaling, vishing, spear phishing, and spoofing.
Dealing with Malicious Software on Personal Computers
●● Malware includes viruses, spyware, keyloggers, worms, Trojans, rootkits, boot sector viruses, ransomware,
on-path attacks, zero-day attacks, DoS (denial-of-service) attacks, DDoS (distributed denial-of-service)
attacks, zombies, botnets, and crypto miners. Attacks on passwords include dictionary, brute force, and
rainbow table attacks.
●● Vulnerability to attack is increased by noncompliant systems, unpatched systems, an OS working past its
end of life, careless programming that allows for SQL injections and cross-site scripting, insider threats,
and lack of user education.
●● Symptoms that indicate malware is present include pop-up ads, browser redirection, desktop alerts, application crashes, failed OS updates, antivirus false alerts, slow performance, error messages and logs, file errors,
email problems, and invalid digital certificates.
●● Some systems become so highly infected that the only solution is to format the hard drive, reinstall Windows,
and restore data from backups.
●● To clean up an infected system, (1) know how to identify common malware symptoms, (2) quarantine
the infected system, (3) disable System Protection, (4) remediate the system, (5) protect the system with
scheduled scans and updates, (6) enable System Protection and create a restore point, and (7) educate the
end user.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to be able to explain the process of an incident response, which includes reporting
prohibited content or activity through the proper channels and to law enforcement as necessary, copying and preserving relevant data and evidence, and tracking evidence through an appropriate chain-of-custody document.
person’s signature on a chain-of-custody document so you can later prove you handled the evidence appropriately. You don’t want the evidence to be disallowed in a court of law because you have been accused of
misconduct or tampering with the evidence. Also know that more information than a signature, such as a
copy of a driver’s license, might be required to identify people in the chain of custody.

Licensing, Regulated Data, and Security Policies
●● The owner of a copyright for software has the right to allow the software to be copied and used and assign
a license to do so, after the user agrees to a EULA (End User License Agreement).
●● Two types of licenses for copyrighted software are a personal use license and a commercial use license.
Two types of open-source licenses are a copyleft and permissive license.
●● Regulatory and compliance policies help protect regulated data, which can include PII (personally identifiable information), PHI (protected health information), PCI (Payment Card Industry) data, and governmentissued personal information that is regulated by governmental agencies.
●● Data can be partly or completely destroyed using a low-level format, zero-fill utility, Secure Erase utility,
drill, hammer, incinerator, degausser, paper shredder, or multimedia shredder.
●● Professional data-destruction vendors may provide a certificate of destruction for legal purposes.
●● A chain-of-custody document is part of incident documentation and provides a paper trail of the evidence
in response to an incident that is suspected to be criminal.

Introduction
In this module, you learn about some tools and techniques to secure the resources on a personal computer and
Windows domain. You learn how to lock down a personal computer from unauthorized access and how to share
resources on the network while protecting them from people who should not have access. Finally, you learn how to
use Active Directory to manage users and resources on a network.
In later modules, you learn more about securing resources on a network, such as configuring a personal firewall
and securing browsers, mobile devices, and wireless networks.
Securing a Windows Personal Computer
Core 2 Objectives 1.2, 1.3, 2.5, 2.6
Recall from earlier modules that securing access to computer resources involves authenticating and authorizing
a user or process and accounting for what a user or process does and when the resources were being used—all
of which is collectively referred to as AAA
security measures. When you have a choice
in the security measures you use, keep in
mind two goals, which are sometimes in
conflict. One goal is to protect resources,
and the other goal is not to interfere with
the functions of the system. A computer or
network can be so protected that no one
can use it or so accessible that anyone can
do whatever they want with it. The trick is
to find the right balance between security
and user convenience (see Figure 17-1).
Also, too much security can sometimes
force workers to find insecure alternatives.
For example, requiring users to change
their passwords weekly might result in
more of them writing their passwords down
to help remember them.
The best protection against attacks is layered protection. If one security method fails, the next might stop an attacker.
When securing a workstation, use as many layers of protection as you reasonably can that are justified by the value of
the resources you are protecting. These layers of defense are collectively called defense in depth.
Note 1
BIOS/UEFI Passwords
Core 2 Objective 2.6
One example of defense in depth is requiring a power-on password as well as a Windows password to access a
Windows workstation. BIOS/UEFI firmware on the motherboard offers power-on passwords, which include an administrator or supervisor password (required to change BIOS/UEFI setup) and a user password (required to use the
system or view BIOS/UEFI setup). Some firmware may also offer a drive lock password, which is required to access
the hard drive. The drive lock password is stored on the hard drive so that it will still control access if the drive is
removed from the computer and installed on another system. Figure 17-2 shows a BIOS/UEFI setup Security screen
where you can set the Administrator and User passwords.

Securing Windows User Accounts
Core 2 Objectives 1.2, 1.3, 2.5, 2.6
When a computer is on a Windows domain, Active Directory (AD) is responsible for AAA services. For a peer-topeer network, authentication, authorization, and accounting must happen at the local computer. As an administrator, when you first create a Windows account, be sure to assign it a password. It’s best to give the user the ability
to change the password at any time. In this section of the module, you learn how to use Local Group Policy, Local
Security Policy, and other Windows 10/11 tools to secure Windows user accounts.
Create Strong Passwords
Normally, Windows authenticates a user with a Windows password. A password needs to be a strong password,
which means it should not be easy to guess either by people or by computer programs using various methods,
including a simple brute force attack, which is guessing with every single combination of characters until it discovers your password.
A strong password, such as y*3Q1693pEWJaTz1!, meets all of the following criteria:
● Use 16 or more characters; a long password is your best protection against a password attack because the
longer the password, the more guesses it takes to discover it. After a few thousand guesses, a hacker is
likely to move on.
● Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Use at least one symbol in your password.
● Don’t use consecutive letters or numbers, such as “abcdefg” or “12345.”

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Don’t use adjacent keys on your keyboard, such as “qwerty.”
● Don’t use your sign-in name in the password.
● It’s best to not use words in any language. Don’t even use numbers or symbols for letters (as in “p@ssw0rd”)
because programs can easily guess those as well.
● Don’t use the same password for more than one system.
Although it’s not recommended you write your password down, if you do write it down, keep it in as safe a place
as you would the data you are protecting. Don’t send your passwords over email or chat.
How secure is a password? Go to howsecureismypassword.net and find out how long it will take a computer to crack the
password.
Note 2
Rather than writing down passwords, consider storing your passwords with a password manager app such as
Dashlane (dashlane.com), Sticky Password (stickypassword.com), or LastPass (lastpass.com). These apps can keep
your passwords in the cloud or on your own device, and the passwords they create are longer and stronger than
those you would be able to memorize.
Don’t type your passwords on a public computer. For example, computers in hotel lobbies or Internet cafés
should only be used for web browsing—not for signing in to your email account or online banking account. These
computers might be running keystroke-logging software put there by criminals to record each keystroke. Several
years ago, while on vacation in a foreign country, I entered credit card information on a computer in a hotel lobby.
Months later, I was still protesting $2 or $3 charges to my credit card from that country. Trust me. Don’t do it—I
speak from experience.
In some situations, a blank Windows password might be more secure than an easy-to-guess password such as
“1234.” That’s because you cannot authenticate to a Windows computer from a remote computer unless the user
account has a password. A criminal might be able to guess an easy password and authenticate remotely. For this
reason, if a computer is always in a protected room such as a home office and the user doesn’t intend to access it
remotely, they might choose not to use a password. However, if the user travels with a laptop, always recommend
that the user create a strong password.
Fingerprints, Facial Recognition, and PINs
Windows account security can be further improved by configuring Windows Hello, a Windows feature that allows
a user to sign in to Windows using their face, iris, fingerprint, or PIN. Captured biometric data, which is digitized,
encrypted, and stored locally on the one Windows device, applies only to that one device and is never transmitted to a server. Because your Microsoft account can be used for single sign-on (SSO), when someone steals your
password, they can access your Microsoft resources from any Windows device; however, your PIN works only on
the one device.
To set up Windows Hello, open the Settings app, and select Accounts and Sign-in options (see Figure 17-3). When
you select Windows Hello Face or Windows Hello Fingerprint in this window, you are also required to set up a PIN,
which can be used if signing in using your face or fingerprint is not an option, such as if you are injured or the face
sensor or fingerprint sensor is not working. Face, fingerprint, and PIN sign-in don’t replace the Windows password,
but they are used in place of the password for this one device. If you have multiple Windows devices, you would
need to set up Windows Hello on each device.

Next, let’s see how Local Group Policy and Local Security Policy consoles can be used to enforce security best
practices on a workstation.
Local Group Policy Editor
You need to be aware of three tools for managing policies that control what users and computers can do with a
system or network:
● Group Policy (gpedit.msc) works in Active Directory on a Windows domain to control the privileges of computers and users on the domain. You learn more about Group Policy and Active Directory later in this module.
● Local Group Policy (gpedit.msc) contains a subset of policies in Group Policy; this subset applies only to
the local Windows 10/11 computer or local user.
● Local Security Policy (secpol.msc) contains a subset of policies in Local Group Policy, which apply only to
the local computer’s Windows security settings. Local Security Policy is a Windows 10 Administrative Tools
or Windows 11 Windows Tools snap-in in Control Panel.
Figure 17-3 Use face recognition, fingerprint or PIN for Windows sign-in
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know about OS login options, including passwords, PINs, fingerprints, facial recognition, and SSO.

Now let’s see how you can use the Local Group Policy editor to secure a workstation. For example, you can set
policies to require all users to have passwords. Once you have enabled a policy, a standard user of the workstation
would be required to comply and would not be able to change the policy.

Applying Local Security Policies
Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.6
Follow these steps to set a few important policies to secure a workstation:
1. Sign in to Windows using an administrator account on a system that uses Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise.
2. To start Local Group Policy, enter the gpedit.msc command in the Windows search box. The Local
Group Policy Editor console opens.
Applying Concepts
The Local Group Policy and Local Security Policy editors are available with business and professional editions
of Windows. Figure 17-4 shows the Local Group Policy Editor window on the left and the Local Security Policy window on the right. Notice that the Local Group Policy editor contains two major categories of policies: Computer
Configuration and User Configuration. The list of policy groups selected are for the computer configuration for
Windows security settings. Compare this list with the one in the Local Security Policy window; they are the same
list of policies. In short, when you are working with the computer configuration in the Windows security settings
group of the Local Group Policy editor, know you are working with the same group of policies you can edit when
using the Local Security Policy editor.

Figure 17-5 Require that each user account have a password by setting the minimum password
length policy
(continues)
For years, the security community has advised changing passwords often, but now security experts advise creating a very strong password and sticking to it unless you think the password has been compromised.
Note 3
● Screen lock timeout. Windows can monitor for inactivity and run the screen saver after a set amount
of time, locking the session. This prevents another person from continuing a Windows session after
the user has stepped away from the computer, which is called tailgating. Drill down to the Computer
Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local Policies, Security Options group. Use
the Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit policy to set the number of seconds of inactivity
before the screen saver runs and locks the workstation until a user signs in.
3. To change a policy, first use the left pane to drill down into the appropriate policy group, and then use the
right pane to view and edit a policy. Here are important policies you can use to secure a workstation:
● Require user passwords and password expiration and complexity. To require that all user accounts
have passwords, drill down to the Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings,
Account Policies, Password Policy group (see the left side of Figure 17-5). Use the Minimum password
length policy, and set the minimum length to at least eight characters (see the right side of Figure 17-5).
● Require password complexity. To require that passwords contain uppercase and lowercase letters,
numbers, and symbols—and do not contain the user name—open the Password must meet
complexity requirements and enable this policy.
● Password expiration. To require users to change their passwords frequently, open the Maximum
password age policy, and set the age to up to 999 days. You can also set the Minimum password age
policy so a user cannot cycle back to a favorite password immediately after they have changed it.

● Set a threshold for failed logon attempts. Windows can be configured to lock a user account if
too many incorrect logons are attempted. Drill down to the Computer Configuration, Windows
Settings, Security Settings, Account Policies, Account Lockout Policy group. Use the Account
lockout threshold policy to set the number of invalid logon attempts. When the number is exceeded,
the account will be locked.
Applying Concepts Continued
Figure 17-6 Use Group Policy to rename a default user account
The Properties dialog box for many policies offers the Explain tab. Use this tab to read more about a policy
and how it works.
Note 4
● Disable the Guest account. For best security, the Guest account should stay disabled; you don’t want
a user to accidentally enable it. To set a policy to disable the Guest account, first use the left pane
to navigate to the Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local Policies,
Security Options group. In the Security Options group, right-click Accounts: Guest account status,
and select Properties. Change the status to Disabled, and click OK.
● Change default user names. A hacker is less likely to hack into the built-in Administrator account
or Guest account if you change the names of these default accounts. To change the name of the
Administrator account, drill down to the Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security
Settings, Local Policies, Security Options group (see the left side of Figure 17-6). In the right pane,
double-click Accounts: Rename administrator account. In the Properties dialog box for this policy
(see the right side of Figure 17-6), change the name, and click OK. To change the name of the Guest
account, use the policy Accounts: Rename guest account.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Audit logon failures. Group Policy offers several auditing policies that monitor and log security
events. You can then review these Security logs using Event Viewer. For example, to set an audit policy
to monitor a failed logon event, drill down to the Computer Configuration, Windows Settings,
Security Settings, Local Policies, Audit Policy group. Use the Audit logon events policy. You can
audit logon successes and failures. To keep the log from getting too big, you can select Failure to log
only these events.
When a computer is on a Windows domain managed by Active Directory, you can block a user from signing in
to Windows locally, using a local account. To do that, go to the Computer Configuration, Windows Settings,
Security Settings, Local Policies, User Rights Assignments, and Allow log on locally policy. Remove the
Users group from those allowed to log on locally. It’s best to still allow the Administrators group to log on locally
in case that logon is needed to troubleshoot the system.
Note 6
All the previous policies are also found in the Local Security Policy console. The following policies are
available only in Local Group Policy:
● Logon time restrictions. In some situations, users should only be allowed access to a workstation
during specific hours, such as during office hours. The schedule for a user’s or group’s logon hours is
set through Active Directory on the domain. When logon hours set by Active Directory have expired,
individual workstations can be configured to disconnect, lock, or log off the user, or to allow the user
to continue the current session. To configure what happens when a user’s logon hours have expired,
drill down to the User Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Windows
Logon Options group. Double-click Set action to take when logon hours expire. Select Enabled, and
then choose Lock, Disconnect, or Logoff. If the policy is not enabled, the user’s session will continue,
but the user will not be able to log on outside of the assigned logon hours once the current session has
been terminated.
● Disable Microsoft account resources. Recall that a Microsoft account is a single sign-on (SSO)
account, which means it provides authentication to multiple services and resources. When a user signs
in to a Windows 10/11 computer with a Microsoft account, they have access to online resources such
as OneDrive and OneNote and can sync settings on the computer with other computers that use the
same Microsoft account. Settings include Start tiles, desktop personalization, installed apps and app
settings, web browser favorites, and passwords to apps, websites, and networks.
To see and edit the sync settings available for a Microsoft account, open the Windows 10/11 Settings app, click
the Accounts group, and select Sync your settings in the left pane.
Note 7
(continues)
The Administrator account is a built-in account that you might need in an emergency when other user accounts
fail. Be sure to create a password for this account. One way to do that is to open an elevated command prompt
window and enter the following commands to activate the account and set its password:
net user Administrator /active:yes
net user Administrator <password>
Because this account and password are extremely valuable and not used very often, don’t trust your
memory—keep the user account name and password in a protected and secure place.

● Disable AutoRun and AutoPlay. When you attach a USB flash drive or external hard drive or insert
a disc in the optical drive, Windows automatically accesses the storage media and then requests
instructions for what to do next. Media files can be played automatically, which is called AutoPlay.
Executable files can be run automatically, which is called AutoRun. You can disable both of these
features to add yet another layer of security protection. To disable AutoPlay, drill down to the
Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, AutoPlay Policies
group. Enable the Turn off Autoplay policy. To disable AutoRun, enable Set the default behavior for
AutoRun and use the Disabled option.
4. When you finish setting your local security policies, close the Local Group Policy Editor console. To
put your changes into effect, restart the system or open a command prompt window, and enter the
command gpupdate /force. The command might request that you restart the computer for all
policies to take effect. The gpupdate command refreshes local group policies as well as group policies set
in Active Directory on a Windows domain.
Depending on your company’s policy, you might need to restrict access to online resources and sync
settings that are linked to a user’s Microsoft account. To disable OneDrive, for example, drill down to
the Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, OneDrive group.
Enable the Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage policy to prevent users and programs from
accessing OneDrive. Additionally, in the Windows Components submenu, click the Sync your settings
group, and use these policies to disable syncing apps, app settings, passwords, and other Windows
settings (see Figure 17-7). You can also block using Microsoft accounts altogether by setting the Block
Microsoft accounts policy in the Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local
Policies, Security Options group.

File and Folder Encryption
Core 2 Objective 2.5
Data needs to be protected when at rest (while stored on a hard drive, flash drive, or other storage device) and in
motion (while being transmitted over a network or the Internet). Encryption is an effective way to protect data, but
the encryption techniques and protocols used are different depending on whether the data is at rest or in motion.
In Windows, data-at-rest encryption can be accomplished using the Windows Encrypting File System (EFS). EFS
encrypts files and folders stored on drives using the NTFS file system and business and professional editions of Windows. If a folder is marked for encryption, every file created in the folder or copied to the folder will be encrypted.
An encrypted file remains encrypted if you move it from an encrypted folder to an unencrypted folder on the same
or another NTFS volume.
To encrypt a folder or file, right-click it and open
its Properties dialog box (see Figure 17-8). On the
General tab, click Advanced. In the Advanced Attributes dialog box, check Encrypt contents to secure
data, and click OK. In Explorer, encrypted file and
folder names are displayed in green by default.
In the module “Network Security and Troubleshooting,”
you learn how to encrypt data in motion on a network
or the Internet.
Note 8
Figure 17-8 Encrypt a folder and all its contents
Now let’s turn our attention to using encryption to secure workstation resources.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know how to secure a workstation in a given scenario, including managing user
accounts. You need to know how to configure password length, characters, complexity, and expiration and how to
restrict user permissions, configure login times, disable the guest account, set failed login attempts before lockout, set
timeout screen locks, change the default administrator user account name and set its password, and disable AutoRun
and AutoPlay. All these settings are done by using the Local Group Policy editor to edit these policies.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know when it is appropriate to use BitLocker Drive Encryption and BitLocker To
Go in a given scenario.
Figure 17-9 Use the Network Places Wizard to
reset a user password
Caution
If a user forgets a password, an administrator can reset
the forgotten password. However, know that if an administrator resets a user password, the user will lose all their
EFS encrypted folders and files, personal digital certificates, and passwords stored on the computer. To reset
a user password, you can use the Network Places Wizard
tool (netplwiz.exe), as shown in Figure 17-9. Select the
user and click Reset Password. Later in the module,
you learn to reset a password using the Local Users and
Groups console.
Bitlocker Encryption
Core 2 Objective 2.5
BitLocker Drive Encryption in Windows professional and business editions locks down a hard drive by encrypting
the entire Windows volume and any other volume on the drive and restricts access by requiring one or two encryption keys. A similar feature, BitLocker To Go, encrypts data on a USB flash drive and restricts access by requiring
a password. You need to be aware of the restrictions and possible risks before you decide to use BitLocker. It’s
intended to work in partnership with file and folder encryption to provide data security.
If the folder or file doesn’t display in a green font in
Explorer, you can change the setting by opening Control
Panel and clicking File Explorer Options. On the View
tab, check Show encrypted or compressed NTFS files
in color. Click OK.
Note 9
The three ways you can use BitLocker Drive Encryption depend on the type of protection you need and the
computer hardware available:
● Computer authentication. Many laptop and desktop computers have a chip on the motherboard called
the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip. The TPM chip holds the BitLocker encryption key (also called
the startup key). If the hard drive is stolen from the computer and installed in another computer, the data
would be safe because BitLocker would not allow access without the startup key stored on the TPM chip.
Therefore, this method authenticates the computer. However, if the motherboard fails and is replaced, you’ll
need a backup copy of the startup key to access data on the hard drive. (You cannot move the TPM chip
from one motherboard to another.) Recall that Windows 11 requires a TPM chip, version 2.0 or higher, which
must be enabled before Windows 11 installs.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● User authentication. For Windows 10 computers that don’t have TPM, the startup key can be stored on a USB
flash drive (or other storage device the computer reads before the OS is loaded). The user installs the flash
drive or enters a personal identification number (PIN) to unlock Windows startup. This method authenticates
the user. For this method to be the most secure, the user must never leave the flash drive stored with the
computer. (Instead, the user might keep the USB startup key on their key ring or a lanyard.)
● Computer and user authentication. For best security, two-factor authentication is used: the TPM chip to
authenticate the computer and the flash drive or PIN to authenticate the user.
Caution
In the module “Security Strategies,” you learned that some data, such as healthcare data, is regulated by the government, and organizations that are negligent in protecting it can be held legally responsible for data breaches. For this
type of data, encryption and other security measures may be mandated by law.
To start the process of using BitLocker Drive Encryption, first go into BIOS/UEFI setup and enable the TPM chip.
Then open the BitLocker Drive Encryption applet in Control Panel (see Figure 17-10). Using this window, you can
click TPM Administration to manage the TPM chip and turn on BitLocker or BitLocker To Go.
Figure 17-10 Manage BitLocker Drive Encryption, the TPM chip, and BitLocker To Go
Most computers manufactured within the last five years implement TPM 2.0, which is required to run Windows 11.
Note 10
BitLocker Drive Encryption provides great security, but security comes with a price. For instance, you risk the
chance your TPM will fail or you will lose all copies of the startup key. In these events, recovering the data can be
messy. Therefore, use BitLocker only if the risks of using it do not outweigh the risks of stolen data. If you decide to
use BitLocker, make extra copies of the startup keys and/or PIN, and keep them in a safe location.

Controlling Access to Folders,
Files, and Printers
Core 2 Objectives 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 2.5
Responsibility for a peer-to-peer network or domain can include controlling access to folders and files for users of
a local computer and for remote users accessing shared resources over the network. Managing shared resources
is accomplished by (1) assigning privileges to user accounts and (2) assigning permissions to folders, files,
and printers.
For detailed instructions on how to set up BitLocker Drive Encryption, see the Microsoft article “BitLocker” at
docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview.
Note 11
In Windows, the terms “privileges” and “permissions” have different meanings. Privileges (also called rights) refer to
the tasks an account is allowed to do in the system, such as installing software or changing the system date and time.
Permissions refer to which user accounts or user groups are allowed access to data files and folders. Privileges are
assigned to an account, and permissions are assigned to data files and folders.
Note 12
Let’s first look at the strategies used for controlling privileges for user accounts and controlling permissions for
folders and files. Then you learn the procedures in Windows for assigning these privileges and permissions.
Classifying User Accounts and User Groups
Core Objectives 1.3, 2.5
In Windows, the privileges or rights assigned to a user account are established when you first create the account and
decide the account type. You can later change these privileges by changing the user groups to which the account
belongs. Recall from the module “Installing Windows” that user accounts can be created using the User Accounts
applet in Control Panel for any edition of Windows. For business and professional editions of Windows, you can
use the Local Users and Groups (lusrmgr.msc) utility in the Computer Management console to create and manager
users and user groups. Home editions of Windows cannot be used to manage user groups, and the Local Users and
Groups utility is missing in the Computer Management console for Home editions.
Type of User Account
When you use the User Accounts applet in Control Panel to manage user accounts, you can choose between two
account types: Administrator or Standard. When you use Local Users and Groups in Computer Management to create an account, the account type is automatically a standard user account.
To create a user account using Computer Management, first open the Computer Management console (compmgmt.msc). Under Local Users and Groups, right-click Users and select New User in the shortcut menu. Enter
information for the new user, and click Create (see Figure 17-11).

Figure 17-11 Create a new user
Built-In User Groups
A user account can belong to one or more user groups. Windows offers several built-in user groups, and you can
create your own. Here are important built-in user groups:
● Administrators and Users groups. By default, administrator accounts belong to the Administrators group,
and standard user accounts belong to the Users group. If you want to give administrator privileges to a standard user account, use the Computer Management console to add the account to the Administrators group.
● Guests group. The Guests group has limited privileges on the system and is given a temporary profile that
is deleted when the user signs out. Windows automatically creates one account in the Guests group named
the Guest account, which is disabled by default.
● Power Users group. Older editions of Windows have a Power Users group that can read from and write to
parts of the system other than its own user profile folders, install applications, and perform limited administrative tasks. Windows 10/11 offers a Power Users group only for backward compatibility with legacy
applications.
To view user groups installed on a system, open the Computer Management console. Under Local Users and
Groups, click Groups (see Figure 17-12).
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to be able to compare privileges assigned to the administrator, standard user, power
user, and guest user groups.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
In addition to the groups you can assign to an account, Windows might automatically assign one of these built-in
user groups to an account when it is determining permissions assigned to a file or folder:
● The Authenticated Users group includes all user accounts that can access the system except the Guest
account. These accounts include domain accounts (used to sign in to the domain) and local accounts
(used to sign in to the local computer). The accounts might or might not require a password. When you
create a folder or file that is not part of your user profile, Windows gives access to all Authenticated Users
by default.
● The Everyone group includes the Authenticated Users group as well as the Guest account. When you share
a file or folder on the network, Windows gives access to the Everyone group by default.
● Anonymous users are users who have not been authenticated on a remote computer. If you sign in to a
computer using a local account and then attempt to access a remote computer, you must be authenticated
on the remote computer. You will be authenticated if your user account and password match on both computers. If you signed in to your local computer with an account and password that do not match an account
and password on the remote computer, you are considered an anonymous user on the remote computer.
As an anonymous user, you might be allowed to use Explorer to view shared folders and files on the remote
computer, but you cannot access them.
Customized User Groups
Recall from the module “Security Strategies” that the principle of least privilege says that a person in an organization
is assigned the privileges necessary to do their job and no more. One convenient way to comply with this principle
is to assign privileges to user groups rather than individual users. First, create a user group based on a job description and then assign permissions to this user group. Any user account that you put in this group then acquires or
inherits the same permissions. For example, you can set up an Accounting group and a Medical Records group for a
small office. Users in the accounting department and users in the medical records department go into their respective user groups. Then you only need to manage the permissions for two groups rather than multiple user accounts.
You learn how to set all this up later in the module.
Methods to Assign Permissions to Folders and Files
Core 2 Objective 1.6
There are two general strategies for managing shared files and folders (also called directories) in Windows:
● Workgroup sharing. With workgroup sharing, all privileges and permissions are set up on each local computer so that each computer manages access to its files, folders, and printers shared on the peer-to-peer
network. The local user decides which users on the network have access to which shared folder and the
type of access they have.
● Domain controlling. If a Windows computer belongs to a domain instead of a workgroup, all security
should be managed by the network administrator for the entire network. Although individual users on
workstations can share files and folders with other users in the domain, this is not considered a security
best practice.
On a Windows peer-to-peer network, each workstation shares its files and folders with others in the workgroup,
or files and folders on a file server are shared. Here are some tips about which folders to use to hold shared data on
a file server or personal computer:
● Private data for an individual user is best kept in the C:\Users folder for that user. User accounts with limited
or standard privileges cannot normally access these folders because they belong to another user account.
However, accounts with administrative privileges do have access.
● The C:\Users\Public folder is intended to be used for folders and files that all users share. It is not recommended that you use this folder for controlled access to data.
● For best security, create a folder that’s not in the C:\Users folder, and assign permissions to that folder and
its subfolders. You can allow all users access or only certain users or user groups.

Some applications can be shared with others on the network. If you share a folder that has a program file in it, a user
on another computer can double-click the program file and execute it remotely on their desktop. This is a handy way
for several users to share an application that is installed on a single computer. However, know that not all applications
are designed to work this way.
Note 13
Share Permissions and NTFS Permissions
Regardless of whether you are sharing to a workgroup or domain, Windows offers two methods to share a folder
over the network:
● Share permissions. Share permissions grant permissions only to network users, and these permissions
do not apply to local users of a computer. Share permissions work on NTFS, FAT32, and exFAT volumes and
are configured using the Sharing tab in a folder’s Properties dialog box. Share permissions apply to a folder
and its contents, but not to individual files.
● NTFS permissions. NTFS permissions apply to local users and network users and to both folders and individual files. NTFS permissions work on NTFS volumes only and are configured using the Security tab in a
file or folder’s Properties dialog box. (The Security tab is missing on the Properties dialog box of a folder
or file on a FAT volume.)
Here are some tips when implementing share permissions and NTFS permissions:
● If you use both share permissions and NTFS permissions on a folder, the more restrictive permission applies.
For NTFS volumes, use only NTFS permissions because they can be customized better. For FAT volumes,
your only option is share permissions.
● If NTFS permissions are conflicting—for example, when a user account has been given one permission
and the user group to which this user belongs has been given a different permission—the more liberal
permission applies.
Inherited Permissions and Explicit Permissions
● Inherited permissions are permissions that are attained from a parent folder. Passing permissions from a
parent object to a child is called permission propagation. When you create, copy, or move an object (file or
folder) that has inherited permissions enabled into a parent folder, the new object takes on the permissions
of the parent folder.
● Explicit permissions apply to an object (folder or file) that has inherited permissions disabled. When an
object with explicit permissions is moved from one parent folder to another on the same volume, the
object retains its original permissions. When an object with explicit permissions is copied from one folder
to another—or moved from one volume to another—it inherits the new parent object permissions because
when copied, a new object is created in the new location.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to compare NTFS and share permissions, including how allow and deny conflicts are
resolved with each and what happens to permissions when you move or copy a file or folder. A project at the end of
this module will help you practice this skill.
How to Share Folders and Files
Core 2 Objectives 1.6, 2.5
Now that you know about the concepts and strategies for managing users and user groups and sharing folders
and files, let’s look at the details of how to use Windows to set up users and user groups and assign file and folder
permissions to these groups.

Creating User Groups and Folder Shares
Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.6
Makani is responsible for a peer-to-peer network at a medical doctor’s office. Four computers are connected to the
small company network; one of these computers acts as the file server for the network. Makani has created two
classifications of data, Financial and Medical. Two workers (Nancy and Adam) require access to the Medical data,
and two workers (Linda and Carlos) require access to the Financial folder. In addition, the doctor, Lucas, requires
access to both categories of data. Makani must do the following to set up the users and data:
1. Create folders named Financial and Medical on the file server. Create five user accounts, one each for
Lucas, Nancy, Adam, Linda, and Carlos. All the accounts belong to the Windows standard user group.
Create two user groups, Financial and Medical.
2. Using NTFS permissions, set the permissions for the Financial and Medical folders on the file server so
only the members of the appropriate group can access each folder.
3. Test access to both folders using test data, and then copy all real data into the two folders and subfolders.
Set up a backup plan for the two folders (as you learned to do in the module “Maintaining Windows”).
Let’s look at how each of these three steps is done.
Applying Concepts
Step 1: Create Folders, User Accounts, and User Groups
Follow these steps to create the folders, user accounts, and user groups on the file server computer that is using
Windows 10/11 Pro:
1. Sign in to the system as an administrator.
2. Using an NTFS volume, create these two folders: C:\Medical and C:\Financial.
3. Open the Local Users and Groups console, and create user accounts for Lucas, Nancy, Adam, Linda,
and Carlos. The account types are automatically standard user accounts.
4. To create the Medical user group, right-click Groups under Local Users and Groups, and select New
Group in the shortcut menu. The New Group dialog box appears. Enter the name of the group (Medical)
and its description (Users have access to the Medical folder), as shown in Figure 17-14.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to be able to set up a user account or group and know how to add and remove
users from a group.
5. Add all the users who need access to medical data (Lucas, Adam, and Nancy). To add members to the
Medical group, click Add. The Select Users dialog box opens, as shown on the right side of Figure 17-14.
Under Enter the object names to select, enter the name of a user. Click Check Names to verify the user.
Click OK. As each user is added, their name appears under Members in the New Group dialog box, as
shown in Figure 17-14. To create the group, click Create in the New Group dialog box.
6. In the same way, create the Financial group, and add Lucas, Linda, and Carlos to the group. Later, you can
use the Local Users and Groups console to add or remove users from either group.
7. Close the Local Users and Groups console.
Applying Concepts Continued
Step 2: Set NTFS Folder Permissions
For User Groups
Follow these steps to set the NTFS permissions for the
two folders:
1. Open Explorer, right-click the Medical folder,
and select Properties in the shortcut menu. The
Properties dialog box for the folder appears.
2. Click the Security tab (see Figure 17-15). Notice in
the dialog box that Authenticated Users, SYSTEM,
Administrators, and Users all have access to the
C:\Medical folder. When you select a user group,
the type of permissions assigned to that group
appears in the Permissions area. Table 17-1
explains the more significant types of permission.
Note that the Administrators group has full
control of the folder. Also notice the checks
under Allow are dimmed. These permissions are
dimmed because they have been inherited from
the parent object. In this case, the parent object is
Windows default settings.

Permission Level Description
Full control Can read, change, delete, and create files and subfolders, read file and folder
attributes, read and change permissions, and take ownership of a file or folder.
Modify Can read, change, and create files and subfolders. Can delete the folder or file but
cannot delete subfolders and their files. Can read and change attributes. Can view
permissions but not change them. Cannot take ownership.
Read & execute Can read folders and contents and run programs in a folder. (Applies to both files
and folders.)
List folder contents Can read folders and contents and run programs in a folder. (Applies only to folders.)
Read Can read folders and contents.
Write Can create a folder or file and change attributes but cannot read data. This
permission is used for a drop folder, where users can drop confidential files that
can only be read by a manager. For example, an instructor can receive student
homework in a drop folder.

5. In the Medical Properties dialog box, notice
the permissions are now checked in black,
indicating they are no longer inherited
but rather explicit permissions and can
be changed. Click Edit to change these
permissions.
6. The Permissions dialog box opens (see
Figure 17-17). Select the Authenticated
Users group, and click Remove. Also
remove the Users group. Don’t remove
the SYSTEM group, which gives Windows
the access it needs. Also, don’t remove the
Administrators group. You need to leave
that group as is so administrators can
access the data.
7. To add a new group, click Add. The Select
Users or Groups box opens. Under Enter
the object names to select, type Medical, as
shown in Figure 17-18. Click Check Names
to verify the group. Click OK. The Medical
group is added to the list of groups and
users for this folder.

9. In a similar way, change the permissions of the C:\Financial folder so Authenticated Users and Users are
not allowed access and the Financial group is allowed full control.
Step 3: Test, Set Share Permissions, and Go Live
It’s now time to test your security measures. Never be tempted to skip testing every aspect of a new security
measure. A security measure that does what you didn’t intend it to do can allow in hackers or lock out wanted users.
Do the following to test the NTFS permissions and implement your shared folders:
1. Test a user account in each user group to make sure
the user can read, write, and delete in the folder they
need but cannot access the other folder. Put some test
data in each folder. Then sign in to the system using an
account you want to test and try to access each folder.
Figure 17-19 shows the dialog box that appears when
an unauthorized user attempts to access a local folder.
When you click Continue, entering an administrator
password in the resulting UAC dialog box gives
you access.
2. Now that NTFS permissions are set correctly for each
local and network user, you are ready to allow access
over the network. To do that, both NTFS and share permissions must allow network access. (Share
permissions apply only to network access, not local access.) The best practice is to allow full access using
share permissions and restrictive access using NTFS permissions. Remember that the most restrictive
permissions apply. To allow full access using share permissions, click the Sharing tab of each folder’s
Properties dialog box, and click Advanced Sharing.
Figure 17-19 Access to a folder is
controlled
3. In the Advanced Sharing dialog box, check Share this folder if it is not already checked. Then click
Permissions. To add a new group, click Add. The Select Users or Groups dialog box opens. Under Enter
the object names to select, type Everyone and click OK. The Everyone group is added to the list of groups
and users for this folder.
4. With Everyone selected, check Allow under Full control to give that permission to the Everyone user
group. Click OK twice, and then close the Properties dialog box.
5. Now that you have the security settings in place for one computer, go to each computer on the network,
and create the user accounts that will be using this computer. Then test the security and make sure each
user can or cannot access the \Financial and \Medical folders, as you intend. To access shared folders, you
can drill down into the Network group in Explorer. Another method is to type the IP address (for example,
\\192.168.1.112) or computer name (for example, \\DELL-LABPC2) in the address bar of the Explorer
window, as shown in Figure 17-20.

subfolders in these folders. Check a few subfolders and files to verify that each has the permissions you
expect. Also, don’t forget to implement the backup procedures on the file server, as you learned in the
module “Maintaining Windows.”

User and Group Information with the gpresult Command
You can pull a list of all the groups a user belongs to with the gpresult command. This information can be helpful when troubleshooting user group issues or Group Policy problems; the command displays user groups a user
belongs to and all the currently applied policies set by Group Policy. To retrieve information about a user other than
the one signed in, open an elevated command prompt window and enter the command:
gpresult /scope user /user username /r

How to Use Share Permissions
Although you can mix NTFS permissions and share permissions on the same system, life is simpler if you use one or
the other. For NTFS volumes, NTFS permissions are the way to go because they can be customized better than share
permissions. However, you must use share permissions on FAT volumes. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Open the Properties dialog box for the folder (Personnel in this case). Notice in Figure 17-23 that the
Security tab is missing because the folder is on a FAT volume. Select the Sharing tab and click Advanced
Sharing. The Advanced Sharing dialog box opens (see the right side of Figure 17-23).
Figure 17-22 shows output for the user Adam; you can verify that he belongs to the Medical group. You learn more
about the gpresult command later in this module.

Support and Troubleshoot Shared Folders and Files
You have just seen how to set up user groups and folder permissions assigned to these groups. If you have problems
accessing a shared resource, follow these steps:
1. Windows might be able to solve the problem for you. In Control Panel, click Troubleshooting. In the
Troubleshooting window, click Access shared files and folders on other computers, and walk through
the Shared Folders troubleshooter.
2. Open the Network and Sharing Center. Make sure your network location is set to Private.
3. In the left pane, click Change advanced sharing settings. The Advanced sharing settings window opens.
See Figure 17-25.
Figure 17-25 Configure the security level for network connections
4. Verify that the settings here are the default settings for a Private network profile:
● Select Turn on network discovery, and make sure Turn on automatic setup of network connected
devices is checked.
● Select Turn on file and printer sharing.
● If you want to share the Public folder to the network, go to the Public folder sharing section under All
Networks, and select Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the
Public folders.
● If you want the added protection of requiring that all users on the network must have a valid user
account and password on this computer, select Turn on password protected sharing.

6. In the Network and Sharing Center, click Change adapter settings. The Network Connections window
appears. Right-click the network connection icon, and select Properties in the shortcut menu. In the
Properties dialog box, verify that File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks is checked (see
Figure 17-26).
Figure 17-26 Verify that the properties for the network connection are set for sharing
resources over the connection
7. The user account name and password on the remote computer must match the user account and
password on the host computer. If these accounts and passwords don’t match, the user is considered
an anonymous user and is denied access to resources shared on the remote computer. To verify that
account names and passwords match, open the Local Users and Groups console, where you can view
user account names, create new accounts, and set or reset passwords.
Here are a few additional tips about managing shared folders and files:
● Use advanced permissions settings. If you need further control of the permissions assigned to a user or
group, click Advanced on the Security tab of a folder’s Properties dialog box. The Advanced Security Settings dialog box appears (see Figure 17-27A). You can see that the Medical user group was given full control.
To change these permission details, double-click the user group. In this example, the Medical group is being
edited. The Permission Entry dialog box opens. Click Show advanced permissions to see these advanced
permissions, as shown in Figure 17-27B.

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to be able to implement permissions so that a user can copy but not move a file or
folder and to understand how to apply Allow and Deny permissions.
Detailed permissions can now be changed. For example, to prevent users in the Medical group from
deleting the Medical folder, its subfolders, and its files, uncheck Delete subfolders and files and uncheck
Delete. Click OK to close each dialog box. The resulting change means that users of the Medical group cannot delete or move a file or folder. (They can, however, copy the file or folder.)

Figure 17-28 Change the owner of a folder
Click to change owner
● Use only one workgroup. On a peer-to-peer network, it’s not necessary that all computers belong to the
same workgroup in order to share resources. However, performance improves when they are all in the same
workgroup.
● Require passwords for all user accounts. Don’t forget that for best security, each user account needs a
password. In a workgroup, the policy to require that all accounts have passwords is set using Local Group
Policy. On a domain, Group Policy is used.
● Use the network path to access a shared folder. To access shared folders on the network in the Explorer
navigation bar or in a command prompt window, type the network path to the share as two backslashes,
the computer name, one backslash, and the folder name, as shown in Figure 17-29 for Explorer and in a
command line in Figure 17-30.
● Use a mapped network drive. For the convenience of remote users, map network drives for shared folders
that are heavily used. How to do that is coming up next.
● Manage permissions using the parent folder. When a subfolder is created, it is assigned the permissions of
the parent folder. Recall that these inherited permissions appear dimmed. The best way to change inherited
permissions is to change the permissions of the parent object. In other words, to change the permissions of
the C:\Financial\QuickBooks folder, change the permission of the C:\Financial folder. Changing permissions
of a parent folder affects all its subfolders.
● Check the effective permissions. Explicit permissions can be manually set for a subfolder or file, which
overrides inherited permissions. When a folder or file has inherited and explicit permission set, it might be
confusing to know exactly which permissions are in effect. To find out, see the Advanced Security Settings
dialog box. (Refer back at Figure 17-27A.) NTFS permissions are reported on the Permissions tab and share
permissions are reported on the Share tab. (If the Share tab is missing, share permissions are not set.) Use
the Effective Access tab to get a detailed report of resources available to a particular user.
● Take ownership of a folder. The owner of a folder always has full permissions for the folder. If you are
having a problem changing permissions and you are not the folder owner, try taking ownership of the folder.
To do that, click Advanced on the Security tab of the folder’s Properties dialog box. The Advanced Security
Settings dialog box appears. Next to the name of the owner, click Change. You can then enter the name of
the new owner (see Figure 17-28). Click Check Names to confirm the name is entered correctly, and click
OK twice.

By default, this client/server arrangement is managed by the Windows Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which
you first learned about in the Core 1 module “Networking Fundamentals.” Alternately, Windows can use the Network
File System (NFS) protocol, which is compatible with Linux and UNIX file sharing on the network. Linux and UNIX also
support Windows SMB via the Samba application. You learn more about Samba in the module “Linux and Scripting.”
Regardless of which protocol is used, host computers using different OSs—such as Windows, macOS, or Linux—can
still share network resources.

How to Map a Network Drive or Network Printer
Core 2 Objective 1.6
A mapped drive, also called a network share, is one of the most powerful and versatile methods of communicating over a network. A mapped drive makes one computer (the client) appear to have a new hard drive, such
as drive E:, that is really hard drive space on another host computer (the server). The client computer creates
and saves a shortcut associated with a drive letter that points to the host computer’s shared folder or drive.
This is called mapping the drive. In addition to mapping a network drive, you can also map a network printer
to a computer.

Mapping a Network Drive and Network Printer
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.6
To set up a network drive, follow these steps:
1. On the host computer, share the folder or entire volume to which you want others to have access.
2. On the remote computer that will use the network drive, open Explorer. In the left pane, click This PC.
For Windows 10, at the top of the window, click the Computer tab, and click Map network drive. For
Windows 11, at the top of the window, click the ... See more icon, and select Map network drive.)
3. The Map Network Drive dialog box opens, as shown on the left side of Figure 17-31. Select a drive letter
from the drop-down list.
Applying Concepts
Figure 17-31 Mapping a network drive to a host computer
4. Click the Browse button, and locate the shared folder or drive on the host computer (see the right side of
Figure 17-31). Click OK to close the Browse For Folder dialog box, and click Finish to map the drive. The
folder on the host computer now appears as one more drive in Explorer on your computer.
When mapping a network drive, you can type the network path to the host computer rather than clicking the
Browse button to navigate to the host. To enter the path, open the Map Network Drive dialog box and type
the network path—for example, \\FILESERVER\Projects—and then click Finish.
Note 16
If a network drive does not work, go to the Network and Sharing Center, and verify that the network connection
is good. You can also use the net use command to solve problems with mapped network drives. You learn about
the net use command in the module “Network Security and Troubleshooting.”

A host computer might be in sleep mode or powered down when a remote computer attempts to make
a mapped drive connection at startup. To solve this problem, configure the host computer for Wake-on-LAN,
as you learned in the Core 1 module “Networking Fundamentals.”

Figure 17-32 Select a network printer identified by its IP address or host name
To install a network printer, follow these steps:
1. In Control Panel in classic view, open the Devices and Printers applet, and click Add a printer. Windows
searches for available printers. If the printer is not found, click The printer that I want isn’t listed. See
the left side of Figure 17-32.
2. In the Add Printer dialog box (see the right side of Figure 17-32), select Add a printer using a TCP/IP
address or hostname, and click Next.
3. Enter the printer’s IP address or hostname, and click Next. Windows searches the network for the
printer. If it finds the printer, the installation proceeds, and you can select the printer manufacturer
and model and then name the printer (for example, CanonInHallway). Alternately, you can provide
printer drivers that you can download to your computer. After the printer is installed, be sure to print
a test page.
If you have problems installing a network printer, do the following:
● To verify the printer is online and you know its IP address, open a command prompt window and use
the ping command, as shown in Figure 17-33.
● Download the printer drivers from the website of the printer manufacturer, and follow the
manufacturer’s directions to install the printer.

Core to Core
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know the difference between a shared printer and a network printer. A printer
installed locally on a computer can be shared with other computers. This is different from a network printer, which is
accessed by each networked computer directly through the network.
Hidden Network Resources and Administrative Shares
Core 2 Objective 1.6
Sometimes you may need to secretly share a file or folder on the
network or ensure that a folder or file is not visible or accessible
from the network or by other users. When you need to protect confidential data from users on the network, you can do the following:
● Disable File and Printer Sharing. If no resources on the computer are shared, use the Network and Sharing Center to disable File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks.
● Hide a shared folder. If you want to share a folder but don’t
want others to see the shared folder in Explorer, add a $ to the
end of the share name in the Advanced Sharing dialog box, as
shown in Figure 17-35. This shared and hidden folder is called
a hidden share. Others on the network can access the folder
only when they know its network path. For example, to access
a shared folder named Personnel$ on the computer named
Desktop77, a user must enter \\Desktop77\Personnel$ in the
Explorer navigation bar.
So far in this module, you have learned about folders and files
on a computer that are shared with other users on the network;
these shares are called local shares. For computers that belong to
a domain, you need to be aware of another way folders are shared,
called administrative shares. Administrative shares are folders
shared by default that administrator accounts at the domain level can access. You don’t need to manually share
these folders because Windows automatically does so by default. The following are two types of administrative
shares:
● The %systemroot% folder. Enter the path \\computername\admin$ to access the %systemroot% folder
(most likely the C:\Windows folder) on a remote computer in order to work with that computer’s system
folders and files. For example, to connect to the ws14 workstation shown in Figure 17-36, the entry in the
Explorer navigation bar is \\ws14\admin$. The authenticate dialog box appears; enter Administrator as
the user name and the password to the Administrator account. The admin$ administrative share is called
the Remote Admin share.

To see a list of all shares on a computer, open the Computer Management console, and drill down to System Tools,
Shared Folders, Shares (see Figure 17-37).
Note 18
Caution
When supporting a workgroup, you might be tempted to share all the drives on all computers so that you can have
easy access remotely. However, using local shares in this way is not a good security practice. Don’t share the \Windows
folder or an entire drive or volume on the network. These local shares appear in everyone’s Explorer window. You don’t
want your system files and folders exposed like this.

Using Active Directory Domain Services
Core 2 Objective 2.1
Recall that Active Directory (AD) is a suite of services and databases provided by Windows Server that is used to
manage Windows domains, including access to the domain and what users and computers can do in the domain.
AD incorporates five groups of services:
● Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) authenticates accounts and authorizes what these accounts
can do.
● AD Certificate Services (AD CS) secures identities of services, computers, and users.
● AD Federation Services (AD FS) secures trust relationships with outside organizations.
● AD Rights Management Services (AD RMS) secures data.
● AD Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) secures applications.
Active Directory organizes resources in a top-down hierarchical structure, as shown in Figure 17-38. Users and
resources of a company or school managed by AD are organized into a forest (the entire enterprise), which contains
a domain (for example, mycompany.com). For a few very large enterprises, domains can contain subdomains (for
example, mycompany.com and mycompany-dev.com), but in most situations, a forest contains only a single domain.
Domains can contain sites (for example, a New York branch office and a San Francisco branch). Domains and sites
are also organized into various organizational units.
Figure 17-38 The Active Directory organizational structure
AD Federation Services
trust relationships Forest Forest
Domain
Organizational unit
Security group Security group Security group

Site Site
Organizational units (OU) are created to make it easier for technicians to assign privileges to users and computers that are assigned to an OU. In general, an administrator creates an OU tree to follow the job descriptions within
an organization. For example, Figure 17-39 shows the Domain Users OU includes everyone in the company. Other
OUs are created based on job responsibilities. Although it is possible to put users and computers in the same OU,
it is not recommended because generally their privileges are very different.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
An OU can contain groups of users or computers called
security groups, which are similar to user groups in a Windows
workgroup except a security group can include a computer or
a user.
Privileges are assigned to OUs using policies created by
Group Policy. These policies are contained in Group Policy
Objects (GPOs) that are applied to the OU and, by inheritance, to
each security group, user, and computer in the OU.
Permissions assigned to folders work much the same way
as they do in Windows 10/11. NTFS and share permissions are
assigned to a folder on a server in the domain by assigning permissions to an OU or security group, and the users in this OU or
group inherit these assigned permissions. In summary, managing
resources in AD revolves around the tools shown in Figure 17-40.
In this module, we focus on the skills an IT technician
needs to manage user accounts with Active Directory Domain
Services—including creating, resetting, unlocking, enabling, and
disabling user accounts; resetting user account passwords; and
managing login scripts. You also learn how Group Policy can be
used to assign privileges to an OU and the security groups and
users in the OU.

Creating and Managing User Accounts in AD
Core 2 Objective 2.1
Before we discuss how to manage a user account on a Windows domain, let’s pause to see how you can access
Domain Services on the domain controller to get to the tools you need. You’ll need a local administrator account
for a Windows Server computer that is a domain controller. Then you can use one of these methods to access the
domain controller:
● Sitting at the computer. While physically seated at the Windows Server computer, sign in to Windows Server
with an administrator account. Then click Start and click Server Manager in the Start menu. The Server
Manager console is shown in Figure 17-41 with the Tools menu open. The Server Manager console contains
the tools used to manage Active Directory and is included in Windows Server. It can also be installed in
Windows 10/11.
Figure 17-41 The Windows Server desktop with the Server Manager console showing the Tools menu
If you don’t have access to Active Directory and a Windows domain to practice the skills in this part of the module, you
can follow the steps in Real Problem 17-2 at the end of this module to set up your own Windows domain in Windows

● Remote access via Remote Desktop. You can use Remote Desktop from anywhere on the Internet to connect
to a Windows Server computer, sign in, and open Server Manager. Details about Remote Desktop are covered
in the module “Network Security and Troubleshooting,” and you get a first look at it in a project at the end
of this module. Remote Desktop is included in Windows 10/11 Pro and Enterprise editions.
● Remote access via Windows Admin Center. Windows Admin Center is a console you download and
install for free in Windows 10/11. It works inside a browser and contains various tools for remotely managing Windows Server.

There are six OUs currently in the domain:
● Domain Controllers is a default OU created when the domain was created. It contains all the domain
controllers managing Active Directory. Our controller is named dcserver.
● Domain Computers and Domain Servers OUs were created by the system administrator directly
under the homerun.com domain so appropriate policies can more easily be applied to the computers
assigned to these OUs.
● Domain Users OU was created directly under the homerun.com domain, and all users will be assigned
to this OU. Domain Users contains two OUs: Financial and Medical. Each of these OUs contains a
security group, and every new user will be assigned to one of these two security groups.
● In Figure 17-42, note the Medical OU is selected, and it contains the MedicalGroup security group and
one shared folder. (You can give an OU and a security group the same name, but to avoid confusion,
use different names.)
3. Double-click the MedicalGroup to view its Properties dialog box. Click the Members tab to see that
Nancy Gomez and Adam Washington are members of the group, as shown in Figure 17-42.

Use Server Manager and Create a New User
Let’s get started learning to use Server Manager. In Server Manager, follow these steps to view the OU structure and
create a new user:
1. Sign in to Windows Server with an administrator account, and open Server Manager.
2. Click Tools (refer back to Figure 17-41), and click Active Directory Users and Computers. (The utility is
also available in Control Panel under Administrative Tools.) The Active Directory Users and Computers
window displays. Figure 17-42 shows the sample domain homerun.com, which belongs to our fictitious
company, Homerun Sports Medicine, Inc.

To share a folder in Active Directory, first set the folder’s NTFS and share permissions for the security group, as you
learned to do earlier in the module. Then, to publish the folder in AD, right-click the OU to which you want to include
the folder, click New, click Folder, and point to the folder. The folder is published in AD and can be found by users
signed in to the domain on client computers.
Note 20
4. To add a new user, you can create the account inside an OU. (Right-click the OU, point to New, and click
User.) Alternately, you can add the new user to the User folder. Right-click User, point to New, and click
User, as shown in Figure 17-43.
Figure 17-43 Right-click the User group or an OU to create a new user
Organizations differ in the methods used to manage OUs, security groups, and users. Some prefer to create all users in
the Users folder and then assign each user to an OU. Other organizations prefer to initially create the user in the OU.
Also, the way OUs are organized differs greatly from one organization to another.
Note 21
5. Enter the user’s first name, last name, and user name (see Figure 17-44A). Click Next. On the next screen,
decide how to handle the password (see Figure 17-44B).

Here are the best practices for these password options:
● Always require a password.
● By default, the password you enter must meet AD’s complexity requirements: It must have at least
eight lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and it cannot contain any three
consecutive letters in the user name or display name.
● The best practice is to require the user to change the password at next logon.
● Notice you can select Account is disabled. This might be appropriate when you are setting up an
account well in advance of the account actually being used.

In summary, users belong to security groups, and security groups belong to OUs. When a policy is applied to
an OU, it is applied to all security groups in the OU and to all users in the security group. When folder permissions
are assigned to a security group, they are assigned to all users in the security group.
Manage Accounts and Passwords
An account might get locked after too many failed attempts to sign in. If the user says they know the password but
the account is locked, do the following to unlock the account:
1. An enterprise domain is likely to have hundreds if not thousands of user accounts. Do one of the
following to locate the account:
● If you don’t know where to find the account, you can use the search utility. Click the search icon in the
Active Directory Users and Computers window (see Figure 17-47).
Figure 17-47 Search for a user account
Search icon
Search the
entire domain
To create a new security group, right-click the OU where you want to add the group, click New, and click Group. You
can then name the group.
Note 22
Near the top of the Find Users, Contacts, and Groups dialog box, notice you can filter the search using
the drop-down menus. Enter the name of the account and click Find Now. Double-click the account in
the list of matches that appears. The account’s Properties dialog box appears.
● If you know where to find the account, drill down to it, right-click it, and select Properties.
2. In the Properties dialog box for the account, select the Account tab (see Figure 17-48), check Unlock
account, and click Apply. The user should then be able to sign in. (Also note that you can click the
Member Of tab to find out which OUs and security groups the user belongs to.)

Follow these steps to reset a forgotten password
and disable, enable, or delete an account:
1. Locate the account and right-click it. In
the shortcut menu, click Reset Password
(refer back to Figure 17-45). In the Reset
Password dialog box (see Figure 17-49),
enter a new password twice. It’s a good
idea to leave the User must change
password at next logon box checked. If the
account has been locked, check Unlock
the user’s account. Click OK.
Figure 17-48 Unlock a locked account
Figure 17-49 Reset the user password
Here are a few other tips to help you manage accounts in Active Directory:
● Disable the Guest account. In Active Directory, the Guest account is disabled by default. For best
security,  leave the account disabled. If you find the Guest account enabled, right-click it and select
Disable Account.
● Logon time restrictions. By default, a user can sign in to AD at any time. Suppose, however, that midnight to
8:00 a.m. every Sunday is restricted for routine maintenance. To set logon time restrictions, open the user’s
Properties dialog box, select the Account tab, and click Logon Hours (see Figure 17-50). Click an hour, and
then click Logon Denied. Notice that in Figure 17-50, midnight to 8:00 a.m. on Sunday is denied.
The user account is considered an object in Active Directory. When you delete an AD object, it goes to the Active
Directory Recycle Bin, where it can be recovered until the Recycle Bin is emptied.
Note 23
2. In the account’s shortcut menu shown earlier in Figure 17-45, note the options to disable and delete an
account. When you click Disable Account, the user cannot sign in, but the account’s user profile still
exists, and you can later enable the account using the same shortcut menu. Click Delete to delete the
account, which deletes the user profile. You can also disable and enable an account and designate when
an account will expire using options on the Account tab of the user’s Properties dialog box.

● Timeout and screen lock. On the Sessions tab of the user’s Properties dialog box, you can limit how long
a session remains disconnected before it ends (never or up to two days), how long an active session stays
up (never or up to two days), and how long an idle session stays up. After you have made your selections,
click Apply to save changes.
● Administrator password. Before AD Domain Services can be configured to be a domain controller on the
network, the Administrator account on its computer must have a strong password (including lowercase and
uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols). To manage the properties of the Administrator account, open
Users in the Active Directory Users and Computers window, right-click Administrator, and click Properties.
See Figure 17-51. To change the password of the Administrator account, you can run the following command
in an elevated command prompt window in Windows Server:
net user Administrator <password>

Many corporations are beginning to use cloud services rather than managing data on their premises. One way to do
this is to set up OneDrive in the Microsoft cloud for each user in the Windows domain. Users are then encouraged to
use their OneDrive for personal files rather than their Home folders stored on a network share.
Note 24
● Home folder. The Home folder is the default folder that
is presented to the user whenever they are ready to
save a file. On a peer-to-peer network, the Home folder
in Windows is normally the Documents folder in the
user profile at C:\Users\username\Documents. Active
Directory is able to change this Home folder location to a
share on the network, which is called folder redirection.
Here are two reasons to apply folder redirection to the
Home folder:
■ On a domain, a user might sign in to different
computers. When their Home folder is stored on the
network, it’s always available and does not need to be
copied to each computer they use.
■ It’s easier for backups to be maintained when all
Home folders are on a network server rather than on
individual workstations. In an organization, individual
workstations are generally not backed up regularly,
but servers on the network are backed up at least
every night.
■ To see if a user’s Home folder is on their local
computer or on the network, select the Profile
tab of the user’s Properties dialog box (see
Figure 17-52). For this user, the Home folder is in
a network share.
Figure 17-52 This user’s Home folder is
contained in a network share
● Logon scripts. A logon script, also called a login script, is a list of commands stored in a script file that is
performed each time a user signs in to Windows. In Active Directory, logon scripts are normally stored on
the domain controllers in a network share named Netlogon. Types of logon scripts supported by Active
Directory include Windows batch files (.bat file extension), VBScript files (.vbs file extension), and PowerShell scripts (.ps2 file extension). After the script file is stored in the Netlogon share, to assign the script to
a single user, select the Profile tab in the user’s Properties dialog box. See Figure 17-52. Under Logon script,
enter the name of the script file along with its file extension.
● Multifactor authentication. Some organizations require multifactor authentication (MFA) to sign in a domain
to protect the credentials of certain privileged users. Azure Active Directory in the Microsoft cloud can
implement the optional Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) system that requires MFA along with other security measures to protect these privileged accounts. In addition, Windows Server Active Directory on premises can provide Privileged Access Management (PAM) that works with MIM to enforce MFA as well as other
security measures. How these systems are implemented is beyond the scope of this text.
Normally, when you want to change a setting for a single user, you use the user’s Properties dialog box, as just
explained. If you need to change settings for all the users in an OU, the best tool to use is Group Policy because
these policies affect multiple users.

Group Policy Objects
Core 2 Objective 2.1
Group Policy can be used on the domain controller to create Group Policy Objects, which contain policies that apply
to an OU. These OU policies apply to users, computers, shared folders, and printers in the OU.
Using Group Policy to manage GPOs is beyond the scope of this text. However, let’s take a quick look at how you
would get started to create and edit a GPO.
Create and Edit a GPO
You learned earlier that you can use the user account Properties dialog box to set a logon script for a single user.
Here is how to create a GPO to set a policy to run a logon or logoff script for all users in the domain or an OU:
1. In the Server Manager window, click Tools and click Group Policy Management. (The tool is also
available in Administrative Tools in Control Panel.)
2. In the Group Policy Management window (see Figure 17-53), drill down into the OUs to find the one to
which you want to apply the GPO. Right-click the OU, and click Create a GPO in this domain, and Link
it here. You can then name the GPO, as shown in the figure, and click OK.
Figure 17-53 Create a new GPO for the Domain Users OU
3. The new GPO appears in the list under the OU and in the Group Policy Objects list. To display details
about the GPO, click it and click OK. The GPO details display in the right pane with the Scope tab
selected.
4. To edit a GPO, right-click it in the left pane, and click Edit. The Group Policy Management Editor window
opens so you can edit the GPO. You can see the GPO name at the top of the left pane of the editor
(see Figure 17-54).

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
5. Just as with Local Group Policy, policies apply to either the computer or the user. You can drill down
into the Computer Configuration or User Configuration policies and find and set the ones you want. For
example, to add a logon script for all users in the OU to which the GPO belongs, drill down in the User
Configuration, Policies, Windows Settings, Scripts (Logon/Logoff) group, as shown in Figure 17-54.
6. When you’re done setting policies, close the GPO editor to return to the Group Policy Management
window.
7. GPO updates are automatically pushed down to clients on the domain in the same site in just a few
minutes. On a client computer, just as with Local Group Policy, you can run the gpupdate /force
command to apply new policies to the client.
Which Policy Wins?
Sometimes policies overlap or conflict. Here is the order in which policies are applied; the last policy to be applied
wins:
1. Local. All local policies are applied first. As you learned earlier, Local Group Policy on the local
computer can create policies that apply to the local computer or users.
2. Site. Policies for sites are applied next.
3. Domain. Policies for a domain are applied next.
4. OU. Policies for an OU are applied next, followed by policies for sub-OUs.
5. Enforced. Policies that are tagged as Enforced policies are applied last and always win over other policies.
Figure 17-54 Drill down into the policies to find the ones you need
To tag a GPO as Enforced, right-click the GPO in the Group Policy Management window, and click Enforced.
Note 25
Where there is a conflict of policies, the last policy applied wins. It’s important to remember the order in
which policies are applied, and the acronym LSDOE (usually pronounced “LS-doe”) can help: Local, Site, Domain,
OU, and Enforced.

Figure 17-55 shows what can happen when there are conflicting policies. In the figure, you see that policies A, B,
C, and D are applied. To understand which policy is applied at each level, follow the diagram from left to right. First,
notice that local policy A wins because policy A does not exist at the site, domain, OU, or enforced level. For policy B,
domain policy B wins over site policy B. For policy C, site policy C wins over local policy C. Although OU policy D
would have won over local policy D, the OU policy D was not applied because it was overridden by enforced policy D.
Therefore, the resultant policies are local policy A, domain policy B, site policy C, and enforced policy D.

To find out the resulting policies for the computer or user, do one of the following:
● In a command prompt window, enter the rsop.msc command. The Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) window
opens, where you can drill down to see the policies set for the computer or user. For example, Figure 17-56
shows the RSoP for the Password Policy.
● In a command prompt window, enter the gpresult /v command, which displays the policies currently
applied to the computer and user. The report is very long; you can save it to an HTML file so you can later
search it. For example, use this command: gpresult /h C:\myfile.html. To view the file, doubleclick it in Explorer. The HTML file opens in your default browser window. Figure 17-57 shows a snip of the
file that includes the Password Policy.

Module Summary
Securing a Windows Personal Computer
● Power-on passwords are managed by BIOS/UEFI firmware on the motherboard and work before Windows
is launched.
● A long password is a strong password.
● Windows allows fingerprints, facial recognition, and PINs to be used to authenticate to Windows. This
authentication data is kept on the local machine and applies only to the one device.
● Use Local Group Policies (gpedit.msc) and Local Security Policies (secpol.msc) to control what users and
computers can do on the computer or network.
● Encrypting File System (EFS) encrypts files and folders on an NTFS file system. BitLocker Drive Encryption
encrypts an entire volume on a hard drive. Both are available on business and professional editions of Windows and make use of a TPM chip on the motherboard.
Controlling Access to Folders, Files, and Printers
● Access to folders and files on a network is controlled by assigning privileges to user accounts and assigning
permissions to folders and files.
● Apply the principle of least privilege when assigning privileges to users. You can change the privileges of
an account by adding it to or removing it from a user group.
● You can create customized user groups to make it easier to manage privileges to multiple user accounts.
● Two ways to share files and folders on the network are to use workgroup sharing in a peer-to-peer network
and Active Directory to control a domain. You can use share permissions and NTFS permissions.
● A mapped network drive makes it easier for users to access drives and folders on the network.
● A Windows domain supports administrative shares. You can also hide network resources so that a user
must know the name of the resource to access it.

Using Active Directory Domain Services
● Active Directory (AD) is a suite of services and databases provided by Windows Server that is used to manage Windows domains.
● Active Directory organizes resources in a top-down hierarchical structure. A forest contains a domain.
Domains can contain sites. Domains are organized into organizational units (OUs) and suborganizational
units.
● Managing resources in AD revolves around the OU, security groups, and NTFS and share permissions. Group
Policies apply to OUs, and NTFS and share permissions apply to folders to control access to the resources
in a domain.
● Active Directory is able to change the Home folder location to a share on the network, which is called folder
redirection.
● The order in which group policies are applied is as follows: local, site, domain, OU, and enforced. Where
there is a conflict in policies, the last policy applied wins.

Thinking Critically
These questions are designed to prepare you for the critical thinking required for the A1 exams and may use
information from other modules and the web.
1. Your organization has set up three levels of classification for data accessed by users on a small network:
• Low security: Data in the C:\Public folder
• Medium security: Data in a shared folder that some, but not all, user groups can access
• High security: Data in a shared and encrypted folder that requires a password to access. The folder is
shared only to one user group.
Classify each of the following sets of data:
a. Directions to the company’s Fourth of July party
b. Details of an invention made by the company president that has not yet been patented
c. Resumes presented by several people applying for a job with the company
d. Payroll spreadsheets
e. Job openings at the company

2. You work in the accounting department and have been using a network drive to post Excel workbook files
to your file server as you complete them. When you attempt to save a workbook file to the drive, you see
the error message: “You do not have access to the folder ‘J:\’. See your administrator for access to this
folder.” What should you do first? Second? Explain the reasoning behind your choices.
a. Ask your network administrator to give you permission to access the folder.
b. Check Explorer to verify that you can connect to the network.
c. Save the workbook file to your hard drive.
d. Using Explorer, remap the network drive.
e. Reboot your PC.
3. What is the command to launch each of the following tools?
a. Local Group Policy
b. Local Security Policy
c. Computer Management console
d. Local Users and Groups console
e. Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP)
4. What hardware component is needed to set up BitLocker Encryption so you can authenticate the
computer?
5. Where in Group Policy can you locate the policy that requires a smart card to be used to authenticate a
user to Windows?
a. Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local Policies, Biometrics
b. Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, System, Logon
c. Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local Policies, Security Options
d. User Configuration, Administrative Templates, System, Logon
6. You open a folder Properties dialog box to encrypt the folder, click Advanced, and discover that Encrypt
contents to secure data is dimmed. What is the most likely problem?
a. Encryption has not been enabled. Use the Computer Management console to enable it.
b. You are not using an edition of Windows that supports encryption.
c. Most likely a virus has attacked the system and is disabling encryption.
d. Encryption applies only to files, not folders.
7. You have shared a folder, C:\DenverCO, with your team. The folder contains information about your
company branch in Denver, Colorado. Your company decides to reorganize into zones, so you move the
folder as a subfolder in the folder G:\Zone3. When your team members try to access G:\Zone3\DenverCO,
they get an error message saying they have been denied access. What happened to the permissions when
you moved the folder to its new location?
8. What command do you enter in the Explorer search box to access the Remote Admin share on the
computer named Fin?
9. In your organization, each department has a folder on a shared drive. Your manager frequently copies the
folder to their local computer to run reports. You have noticed that the folder for your department keeps
disappearing from the shared drive. You discover that the folder isn’t being deleted and often gets moved
into a random nearby folder. You suspect that coworkers in other departments are being careless with
their mouse clicks while accessing their own folders on the shared drive and are dragging and dropping
your department folder into other folders without noticing. How can you prevent this folder from being
moved but still allow it to be copied? What steps do you take?
10. If you are having a problem changing the permissions of a folder that was created by another user, what
can you do to help solve the problem?

in another?
a. It will be easier to inventory computers in the domain.
b. It will help organize users into user groups.
c. An OU must contain either users or computers but not both.
d. Policies generally apply to either computers or users.
12. You have set up a user group named Accounting and have put all employees in the accounting department
in this group, which has been given permission to use the Financial folder on a file server. You are now asked
to create a subfolder under Financial named Payroll. Megan, the payroll officer, is the only employee in the
accounting department allowed to access this folder. What is the best way to configure the new share?
a. Assign Megan read/write permissions to the Payroll folder, and explain to your manager that it is not a
best practice to give only one employee access to an important folder.
b. Assign Megan read/write permissions to the Payroll folder.
c. Create a new user group named Payroll, put Megan in the group, and assign the group read/write
permissions to the Payroll folder.
d. Ask your manager to allow you to put the folder outside of the Financial folder so you can assign a new
user group read/write permissions to this folder that will not conflict with the Accounting user group.
13. Which of the following is true about NTFS permissions and share permissions? (Choose all that apply.)
a. Share permissions do not work on an NTFS volume.
b. NTFS permissions work only on an NTFS volume.
c. If share permissions and NTFS permissions are in conflict, NTFS permissions win.
d. If you set NTFS permissions but do not set share permissions, NTFS permissions apply on the network.
14. Which security features are available on Windows 10 Home? (Choose all that apply.)
a. Local Group Policy
b. NTFS permissions
c. Active Directory
d. Share permissions
15. When NTFS and share permissions are used on the local file server, can a user signed in on a Windows 10
Home computer access these shares? Why or why not?
a. No, because Windows 10 Home does not have the Local Users and Groups console
b. No, because Windows 10 Home does not support NTFS permissions
c. Yes, because Windows 10 Home can join a Windows domain
d. Yes, because the user is authenticated on the file server to access its shares
16. Which Windows tool is used to reset the password for a user’s Windows account?
a. Network Places Wizard (netplwiz.exe)
b. Local Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)
c. Accounts page in the Settings app
d. Disk Management
17. As the new network administrator managing Active Directory in your organization, you decide to set up a
backup system for all folders in the domain authorized for users to store their data. Which tasks should
you do first before you configure the backup routine? (Choose all that apply.)
a. Have a company-wide gathering to explain the idea to all users.
b. Evaluate backup software and storage requirements.
c. Apply all available updates to Windows Server.
d. Apply folder redirection to the Home folder for each user.

Hands-On Projects
Exploring Password Management Software
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.5
Password management software, also called password vault software—such as KeePass (keepass.info), LastPass
(lastpass.com), and Dashlane (dashlane.com)—can hold your passwords safely so you don’t forget them or have to
write them down. Choose one of these programs and a second of your own selection that interests you, then answer
the following questions about each one:
1. Which platforms are supported?
2. Which web browsers are supported?
3. From how many competitors can the program import passwords?
4. What types of authentication are supported (e.g., master password, fingerprint, etc.)?
5. Where are the passwords stored? Are they synced across devices? How is the information protected?
6. What are some of the differences between the free edition of each program and the paid versions?
7. What happens to the user’s account if the user dies or is incapacitated?
Hands-On Project 17-1
Using Group Policy to Secure a Workstation
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.5
Using Windows 10/11 Professional or Enterprise, set local security policies to require a password for each account, to
audit failed logon events, and to create a logon script that displays the message, “The Golden Pineapple Was Here!”
when anyone signs in to the system. Test your policies by verifying that a password is required, your script executes
when you sign in, and a failed sign-in event using an invalid password is logged and can be viewed in Event Viewer.
Answer the following questions:
1. Which policies did you set, and what setting was applied to each policy?
2. What software did you use to create your script? What is the exact path and file name (including the file
extension) to your script?
3. Which log in Event Viewer shows the logon failure event?
4. List three more policies you find in Group Policy that can make a workstation more secure but are not
discussed in this module.

Researching a Laptop with a TPM Chip
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.5
Many laptops sold today have a TPM chip, and some have encryption-enabled hard drives that don’t require
encryption software such as BitLocker. Research the web for a laptop that offers a TPM chip and answer these
questions:
1. What is the brand and model of laptop that has the TPM chip? Save or print the webpage that lists the
laptop specifications for the chip.
2. Is the chip optional? If so, what is the cost of including the chip?
3. Does the laptop have an encryption-enabled hard drive?
4. Does the laptop come bundled with encryption software? If so, what is the name of the software?
5. Does the laptop offer a drive lock password?
6. What is the cost of the laptop, including the TPM chip?
Hands-On Project 17-3
Sharing and Securing a Folder
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.5
Using two computers networked together, do the following to practice sharing and securing folders using Windows:
1. Create a user account named User1 on Computer 1. In the Documents folder for that account, create
a folder named Folder1. Create a text file named File1 in the folder. Edit the file and add the text
Golden Egg.
2. On Computer 2, create a user account named User2. Try to read the Golden Egg text in File1 on
Computer 1. What is the result?
3. Configure the computers so that User1 signed in to Computer 2 can open File1 and edit the text “Golden
Egg,” but User2 cannot view or access the contents of Folder1. List the steps you took to share and secure
the folder and to test this scenario to make sure it works.
4. Now make the folder private so that it cannot be seen from Computer 2 in Explorer but can be accessed if
User1 knows the folder name. Describe how you did that.

Demonstrating Inherited and Explicit Permissions
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.5
In this activity, you set up situations to demonstrate how inherited and explicit permissions work. Do the following:
1. Sign in to Windows with an administrative account. Create two folders C:\Folder1 and C:\Folder2 on your
hard drive.
2. Create the following text files. Be sure to put some text in each file:
● C:\Folder1\File1.txt
● C:\Folder2\File2inherited.txt
● C:\Folder2\File3explicit.txt
3. Create a user account named User1.
4. Set the following permission:
● User1 has full permission for access to Folder1.
● User1 cannot access Folder2.
● Change the permissions for C:\Folder2\File3explicit.txt from inherited permissions to explicit
permissions.
5. Sign in to Windows with the User1 account, and verify that User1 can view and modify File1.txt in Folder1
but cannot access the contents of Folder2.
6. Sign in to Windows with your own administrative account.
7. With inherited permissions set, you would expect that File2inherited.txt will inherit the permissions of
Folder1 when the file is copied or moved to Folder1. With explicit permissions set for File3explicit.txt, you
would expect that File3explicit.txt retains its permissions when it is moved from Folder2 to Folder1. To verify
this theory, move (don’t copy) both files to Folder1. Open the Security tab for each file, and verify one file
inherited the permissions of Folder1 and the other file retained its original permissions.
8. Sign in to Windows with the User1 account.
9. Verify that User1 can access the contents of C:\Folder1\File2inherited.txt but cannot access the contents of
C:\Folder1\File3explicit.txt.
10. Sign in to Windows with your own administrative account. You have demonstrated that a file with explicit
permissions retains its permissions when moved to a new parent folder. What happens when you copy the
file? To find out, move File3explicit.txt back to Folder2, and then copy (don’t move) it to Folder1. Check the
file’s Security tab, and note that File3explicit.txt inherited the permissions of Folder1 when copied to the
folder. This occurred because, when you copy a file, a new file is actually created in the new location and
therefore inherits the permissions of the new parent folder.
11. It’s interesting to note that when you move or copy a file from one NTFS volume to another NTFS volume,
the file always inherits the permissions of the parent object. This is because, when a file is moved or copied
to a new volume, a new file is always created on the new volume, and, therefore, inherits permissions of its
parent object. If you have access to two NTFS volumes on the same computer, you can set up this scenario
and verify these actions.

Setting Up a Windows Domain in Google Cloud
Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.1
In the Core 1 module “Network Infrastructure and Cloud Computing” you used Google Cloud Platform to create
a VM with Windows Server installed. To use that VM or a new VM to create a Windows domain, do the following:
1. Go to cloud.google.com. If you have not already set up a free trial, click Get started for free. You will need
to sign in using a Google account. If you don’t have an account, you can create one with any valid email
address. When you first set up an account, you must enter payment information, which Google promises
not to use during your free trial period. Create an individual account type, enter your information, and click
START MY FREE TRIAL. Google automatically sets up your first project, aptly named My First Project.
2. In the left pane of the Google Cloud Platform page, click Compute Engine. (If you don’t see the left pane,
click the three-bar icon in the top-left corner.) If you don’t already have a VM created with Windows Server,
do the following:
a. Click CREATE INSTANCE in the VM instances menu to create a VM.
b. Use the default settings, except:
● Change the name of the VM to dcserver.
● Change the Boot disk to Windows Server 2019 Datacenter.
c. Click Select, click Create, and then wait for Google to create the instance.
3. In the VM instances list, click the dcserver instance, which takes you to the VM instance details page. Click
Set Windows password and assign a user name to your VM instance. Note the user name and click SET.
Google Cloud assigns a password, which displays on the screen. Copy the password, save it somewhere
safe, then click CLOSE.
4. A domain controller needs a static IP address on the domain. To set the Primary internal IP address to a
static address, follow these steps:
a. On the VM instance details page, in the Network interfaces group under Network, click default. The VPC
network details page appears.
b. Click STATIC INTERNAL IP ADDRESSES. Then click RESERVE STATIC ADDRESS.
c. Under Name, enter dcserver. Click RESERVE.
5. To return to the list of VM instances, click the three-bar icon in the top-left corner, and then click Computer
Engine. Click VM instances. Your list of VMs appears.
6. For the dcserver VM instance, write down the Internal IP and External IP addresses.
Real Problem 17-2
Remote Desktop is a Windows utility that allows you to remotely control another computer. In this project, you
use Remote Desktop from your workstation to remotely control your Windows Server in Google Cloud. You
learn more about Remote Desktop in the module “Network Security and Troubleshooting.”
Note 26
7. You are now ready to use Remote Desktop with screen and file sharing to access your VM. Follow these steps:
a. Enter mstsc in the Windows 10/11 search box. In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, enter the
External IP address of your VM, which is its public IP address available on the Internet. Click Connect.
b. In the Enter your credentials box, enter your Windows user name and password to dcserver. Click OK
to connect.

9. You are now ready to set up your Windows domain. Follow these steps:
a. In the Server Manager window, under Configure this local server, click Add roles and features. The Add
Roles and Features Wizard opens. Click Next.
b. On the Select installation type page, accept the default values, and click Next.
c. On the Select destination server page, accept the default values, and click Next.
d. Under Select server roles, check Active Directory Domain Services, and click Add Features.
e. Under Select server roles, check DNS Server and click Add Features. A warning message appears. Click
Continue. (The message was caused by Google Cloud handling tasks that the domain controller would
normally handle.)
f. Click Next four times to step through pages in the wizard, accepting default values. When the Confirm
installation selections page appears, check Restart the destination server automatically if required,
and click Yes to confirm. Then click Install. Wait while the installation happens. You can click the flag
in the upper-right corner of the Server Manager window to view the progress. See Figure 17-58. When
the process finishes, click Close to close the Add Roles and Features Wizard.

10. Although AD Domain Services is now installed, you cannot promote the server to a domain controller until
you first set a password for the all-powerful Administrator account. (Recall that this account is different
from your user name account, which has Administrative privileges.) To set the password, do the following:
a. To open an elevated command prompt window, enter cmd in the Windows search box, right-click
Command Prompt, and click Run as administrator. Respond to the UAC dialog box.
b. Use a password that satisfies AD complexity requirements. For example, in the command prompt
window, enter this command:
net user Administrator Passw0rd /passwordreq:yes
c. Close the command prompt window.
11. Click the notification flag in the Server Manager window, and then click Promote this server to a domain
controller. The Deployment Configuration window appears. Select Add a new forest. Enter your root
domain name. You can use homerun.com or another domain name. Click Next.
12. In the Domain Controller Options window, enter the DSRM password twice, and click Next. Ignore any
warning messages and click Next several times to step through the wizard. Finally, click Install.

13. After the system reboots, you will need to connect again through Remote Desktop. At this point, you
have a working domain controller and can practice the skills you learned in this module to manage Active
Directory. Here is how to get started:
a. Each time you use Remote Desktop to connect to the server, check the VM instances page to verify the
external IP address that you use with Remote Desktop has not changed. Use the current external IP
address.
b. On the Windows Server desktop, if Server Manager is not already open, click Start and click Server
Manager.
c. In the Server Manager window, to manage OUs, user groups, and users, click Tools and then click
Active Directory Users and Computers. (Refer back to Figure 17-42.)
d. By default, your domain has one OU: Domain Controllers. To create another OU directly under the
domain, right-click the domain name, point to New, and click Organizational Unit (see Figure 17-59).
You can then name the OU.
14. Have fun poking around and learning to use Active Directory! Every great IT technician needs to have a
working knowledge of AD, and you have started to develop that in this module. When you’re finished
working with AD, avoid accumulating any charges against your free quota by shutting down the server VM in
the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box.
You will use the Google Cloud Platform service for another project in the module “Linux and Scripting.” Do not
disable your Google Cloud Platform account until after you have completed that project.

Introduction
Many employees expect to be able to use their mobile
devices to access, synchronize, and edit data on the
corporate network. To protect this data, corporations
require that employee mobile devices be secured and
that data, settings, and apps be synchronized to other
storage locations. In this module, you learn how to
secure mobile devices. You also learn about tools and
resources available for troubleshooting mobile operating systems and apps.
Backing Up Mobile Devices
Core 2 Objectives 1.8, 2.7
Methods of backing up mobile devices rely heavily on the OS they use. Currently, the most popular mobile OSs
are Android by Google (google.com) and iOS and iPadOS by Apple (apple.com). Here is a summary of the tools and
techniques covered in more detail in the Core 1 module “Supporting Mobile Devices”:
● Navigating Android and iOS. The OS provides a home screen; navigation interface; and ways to download,
install, uninstall, open, and close apps.
● Settings. The Settings app is used to manage most OS and app settings, although some app settings can be
managed within the app.
● Quick access settings. Each OS has a quick-access settings screen that is easily accessed from the home
screen. Android uses the notification area, and iOS uses the Control Center.
● OS updates. Updates to the OS are managed in the Settings app and are normally set to automatically
download and update.
● Wireless connections. Wireless connections on a mobile device can include cellular voice and data, Wi-Fi,
GPS, Bluetooth, NFC (near-field communication), and AirDrop (Apple only). These connections are managed
in the Settings app.
● Purpose of MDM. Large corporations use mobile device management (MDM) software on both the server
and mobile device to enforce MDM policies designed to secure corporate data and apps (for example, email)
for both corporate-owned and personal devices. For personal devices, these policies are known as BYOD
(bring your own device) policies.
● Data syncing. Google and Apple both provide methods for syncing data via the cloud among mobile devices
that use the same Google or Apple account. This data includes email, contacts, calendars, photos, document
files, and other content. Sync settings are managed in the Settings app or in individual apps that manage
content (for example, the Photos or email app). Synced data is available in the cloud at google.com for
Goggle and iCloud.com for Apple.
● Troubleshooting. When troubleshooting a
mobile device, useful techniques include
updating the OS and restarting and rebooting
the device. A technician might be called on to
solve problems related to malware infections,
display and touch screen issues, connectivity
issues, damaged ports and liquid damage, and
battery, overheating, and charging issues.
In this section of the module, you learn about
updating and backing up mobile devices.
Exam Tip
There is quite a bit of overlap between the CompTIA A1
Core 1 (220-1101) exam objectives and the A1 Core 2
(220-1102) exam objectives regarding mobile devices. For
this reason, this Core 2 module relies heavily on the content already presented in the Core 1 module “Supporting
Mobile Devices.” If you have not already studied that
module, it would be helpful to read it before you turn
your attention to this module.
In this module, we dig deeper into several of the skills
listed earlier. If you are not familiar with each of these
skills—including how to navigate, update, and manage
each OS and troubleshoot a mobile device—now would
be the time to review this content in the Core 1 module
“Supporting Mobile Devices.”

Update the OS
Core 2 Objective 2.7
Updates to the Android OS are automatically pushed to the device from the
manufacturer. Because each manufacturer maintains its own versions of
Android, these updates might not come at the same time Google announces
a major update, which limits availability of updates for some devices. Also,
vendors don’t continue to make these modifications indefinitely—eventually,
a device ages out of the vendor’s updates in what’s called an end-of-life (EOL)
limitation. When the device does receive notice of an update, it might display
a message asking permission to install the update. With some devices, you
can also manually check for updates at any time, but not all devices provide
this option.
To see if manual updates can be performed on an Android device, go
to the Settings app and tap System, Advanced, and System update (see
Figure 18-1). Tap Check for update. The device turns to the manufacturer’s
website for information and reports any available updates.
To check for and install updates on an iOS device, you must first be
signed in to your device with an Apple ID, which requires an associated credit
card number. Then open the Settings app, and tap General and Software
Update. Any available updates will be reported here and can be installed (see
Figure 18-2A). Tap the right arrow next to “Automatic Updates” to view and
change update settings (see Figure 18-2B).

Mobile Apps Development
Core 2 Objective 1.8
Both Android and iOS offer tools for mobile app development that you can use to learn more about supporting and
securing mobile devices. To write and test Android apps, an app developer uses a group of tools in an SDK (software
development kit), such as Android Studio (developer.android.com) or Visual Studio (visualstudio.microsoft.com).
An Android SDK includes an Android emulator, which is software that creates a virtual Android device complete
with virtual hardware (buttons, camera, and
even device orientation), a working installation
of Android, and native apps (see Figure 18-3A).
Android Studio is free and is released as open
source. In a project at the end of this module, you’ll
download and install Android Studio, and then use
it to create virtual Android devices or emulators.
Apple offers its own app-development tools,
including the iOS SDK (software development kit),
collectively called Xcode at developer.apple.com.
Xcode installs free in macOS along with Apple
emulators for testing apps (see Figure  18-3B).
Although the tools are not available in Windows,
there are several workarounds, such as React
Native (reactnative.dev), which can install in Windows and build iOS apps using JavaScript, and
MacInCloud (macincloud.com), which provides
macOS virtual machines that can be used to build
iOS apps in the cloud. In a project at the end of
this module, you’ll download and install Xcode
on a Mac computer and use it to run an iPhone
emulator.
Figure 18-3 (A) Android emulator with the app drawer
open; (B) iPhone 11 Pro emulator with home
screen
(A) (B)
You can follow along with the steps in the following sections using a real smartphone or tablet (Android or iOS), or you
can use an Android, iPhone, or iPad emulator. Projects at the end of this module give you step-by-step instructions to
install and configure the free Android Studio (which includes several Android emulators) on a Windows computer and
the Xcode simulators on a Mac computer. You can use these emulators with real features that work like those on a
physical device, including a power button, rotate capability, camera function, and much more.
Note 1
The first step to secure a mobile device is to maintain good backups. How to back up a device is discussed next.
Backup and Recovery
Core 2 Objective 2.7
In the module “Supporting Mobile Devices,” you learned to back up app data, which is an important skill. If, however,
your mobile device is lost, stolen, or damaged beyond repair, you might need to recover not only app data but also
mobile device settings, configurations, and profiles. This section of the module covers how to back up the entire
device. Let’s start with a summary of backup options:
● File-level backup. Syncing emails, contacts, calendars, photos, and other data through online accounts or
to your computer is called a file-level backup because each file is backed up individually. File-level backups,
however, don’t include your OS settings, such as your Wi-Fi passwords, account profile, or device and app
configuration.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Partial image-level backup. A true image-level backup includes everything on the device and can completely restore the device to its previous state. A mobile device OS, however, offers only a partial image-level
backup that includes settings, native app data, Wi-Fi passwords, the account profile, and device and app
configuration. Third-party app configurations and their data are not included in the OS backup.
● Combination of file-level and partial image-level backups. To prepare for catastrophic failure or loss, you
need to use both backup methods: Sync app data to your computer or the cloud, and use the OS backup for
other types of data and settings. Make sure that syncing and backups include critical apps, their configuration, and data. In reality, though, backups for mobile devices will miss some configurations, such as app
installations or third-party app configurations. For this reason, you might also need third-party software,
such as Dr.Fone (drfone.wondershare.net), to make a full device backup that includes third-party apps and
app data.
Generally, you can back up to the cloud or to your computer. Let’s look next at how Android backs up to Google
Drive.
Google Drive Backup
To enable Android’s backup feature, open the Settings app, and tap System and then Backup. Make sure that Back
up to Google Drive is turned on, and change the backup account if needed. You can also fine-tune what content is
included in the backup and back up now. Your backup data is stored on Google servers and is associated with your
Google account. When you first turn on a new Android device, you are given the chance to enter your Google account
information and restore an existing Google backup to the new device.
Caution
You cannot restore a backup to a new device if the new device uses a version of Android that is lower than the Android
version of the old device.
Back Up Android Data to a Computer
You can use a USB cable to transfer files between an Android device and a computer. Connect the cable and then
open the Settings app. Tap Connected devices and then USB, and select File Transfer. Content can then be accessed
in Explorer on a Windows computer (see Figure 18-4) or in Finder on a Mac.

To create a detailed backup of an Android device—including the device
configuration as well as the content—to a computer, you need a third-party
app or a manufacturer’s app. First check with the device manufacturer for its
backup app. To use the app, you’ll need to first set up a user account with the
manufacturer. Also know that an Android device manufacturer is likely to provide cloud storage to keep remote backups of your device.
iCloud Backup
An iPhone or iPad can back up to a computer or to the cloud using iCloud. The
best practice is to use both methods. To set up iCloud backups, go to Settings,
tap the user name, and then tap iCloud. Scroll down and tap iCloud Backup.
See Figure 18-5. When you turn on iCloud Backup, it backs up daily whenever
the device is plugged into a power source and connected to Wi-Fi, the screen
is locked, and there’s enough unused iCloud storage to hold the backup. However, you can also create a new backup at any time by clicking Back Up Now,
as shown in Figure 18-5. iCloud backs up app data, call history, device settings, text, photos, and videos unless these items are already included in iCloud
syncing.
Back Up iOS to a Computer
An iPhone or iPad can back up to a Mac computer without any extra software.
On a Mac, connect the iPhone or iPad to the Mac using a cable (for example, a
Lightning to USB cable). Unlock the device, and open the Finder window. (The
Finder window is similar to Explorer in Windows.) Select the device in the left
pane (see Figure 18-6). In the right pane, select General and Back up all of the
data on your iPhone to this Mac, as shown in the figure. Notice you also have
the option to encrypt the backup. Click Back Up Now.

Back Up an iPhone or iPad to a Windows Computer
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.7
On a Windows computer, do the following to back up an iPhone or iPad:
1. Go to the Microsoft Store, and search for iTunes. Download and install iTunes by Apple Inc. iTunes is
used to manage digital entertainment media, and its secondary purpose is to back up Apple devices on a
Windows computer.
2. Open iTunes, connect your iPhone or iPad to the computer with a USB cable, and unlock the device.
3. You’ll need to enter your passcode to the device or respond to a message on the device asking whether
you trust the computer. Enter your response.
4. A message in iTunes asks if you want to allow the computer to access the device. Click Continue.
5. In the iTunes window, click the device icon near the top of the screen (see Figure 18-7).

If you’re about to buy a new phone or tablet, be sure to back up your old device before you switch your carrier service
or your Google or Apple account to the new device. If possible, also back up your phone or tablet before taking it in
for repair at a service center.
Note 2
Later, if you need to recover from the backup, connect your device to the computer, and in the Finder window
on a Mac or iTunes window on a Windows computer, select your device. Then click Restore Backup (refer back to
Figure 18-6). You can then select a backup based on the date of each backup.
Figure 18-8 Use iTunes to back up an iPad to this Windows computer
Applying Concepts Continued
Recover from the Backup
Here are two situations when you might want to use a backup to recover a device:
● To the original mobile device. If you have reset the device while troubleshooting a problem and have a
backup in the cloud, sign in to the device using your Google or Apple account. You will then be given the
option to recover from backup or set up the device as a new device. You’ll learn more about resetting a
device later in this module. For iOS, if you have a backup on your computer and connect the device to your
computer, macOS or iTunes in Windows gives you the option to restore from backup.
Whatever backup method you use, it’s important to occasionally test the backup recovery process to verify
that you know how to use it, the recovery works, and you know exactly what’s being recovered. After you test
the recovery process, you might realize you need additional backup methods in place to make sure everything is
covered.

● To a new device. The same recovery options are offered when you first sign in to a new mobile device
using your Google or Apple account—or, for iOS, when you connect a new device to your Mac computer or
Windows computer with the iTunes app. When you’re setting up a new device, the setup process asks if you
want to restore content from a previous backup and also asks which backup to use.
Securing Mobile Devices
Core 2 Objectives 2.1, 2.7, 3.5
Because smartphones and tablets are so mobile, they get stolen more often than other types of computers. Therefore, protecting data on a mobile device is especially important. Consider what might be revealed about your life if
someone stole your smartphone or tablet and the data on it.
● Your apps and personal data could expose email, calendars, call history, voice mail, text messages, Google
Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, banking apps, Dropbox, iCloud Drive, Google Maps, Gmail, QuickMemo, YouTube,
Amazon, Facebook, videos, photos, notes, contacts, and bookmarks and browsing history in web browsers.
● Videos and photos might reveal private information and might be tagged with date and time stamps and
GPS locations.
● Network connection settings include Wi-Fi security keys, email configuration settings, user names, and
email addresses.
● Purchasing patterns and history as well as credit card information might
be stored—or at least accessible for use—in mobile payment apps, in
apps developed by retailers, through membership card databases, or
through email records.
To keep your data safe, consider what apps you can use to protect your
data, how to control access to your device, and which BYOD (bring your own
device) policies might be used in an enterprise environment to secure corporate data stored on a device.
Most of the methods discussed here require the user to understand the
importance of a security measure and how to use it:
● OS updates and patches. Apply OS updates and patches to plug up security holes. Recall that Android automatically pushes updates to many of
its devices, but iOS devices require manual updates.
● Antivirus/anti-malware. Because Apple closely protects iOS and its
apps, it’s unlikely an Apple device will need anti-malware software. The
Android OS and apps are not as closely guarded, so Android anti-malware
apps are recommended. Before installing one, be sure to read reviews
about it. Most of the major anti-malware software companies provide
Android anti-malware apps.
● Firewalls. As with Windows computers, a firewall on a mobile device
helps control which apps or services can use network connections. When
you install an app, you’re required to agree to the permissions it requests
in order to get the app. A firewall gives you more control over an app’s
network access. For example, a firewall can prevent the Facebook app
from sending SMS messages.
Most firewall apps for Android devices mimic a VPN connection,
which forces all network communication to be routed through the
firewall. Figure 18-9 shows an example of one firewall app, NetGuard
(netguard.me), on an Android smartphone; the app allows you to decide
which other apps can use the networks.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● iOS locator application and remote wipe. Similar to Android’s Find My Device, iCloud offers the ability to
locate a lost iOS device if the feature is already enabled on the device before it’s lost. On an iPad or iPhone,
open the Settings app, tap the user name, and turn on Find My iPad or Find My iPhone. To find the device,
using any browser, go to icloud.com/find and sign in with your Apple ID. Besides using a browser on a computer to find your device, you can also download Find My iPhone or Find My iPad to another Apple device
and use it to locate your lost device. Both apps are free. If your device was stolen or you have given up on
finding your device, you can use iCloud to perform a remote wipe.
Device Access Controls
Core 2 Objective 2.7
To control access to the device, consider the following lock methods:
● Lock the screen. A screen lock requires the correct input to unlock the device. Mobile devices provide a variety
of options for unlocking the screen. As the complexity of a lock code increases, so does the security of the device:
■ Swipe lock. Swipe your finger across the screen to unlock the device. (This is not very secure, but it
prevents a pocket dial.)
Figure 18-10 Locate a lost Android device using any web-enabled computer or mobile device and
your Google account
● Android locator application and remote wipe. You can use Find My Device (google.com/android/find),
Android’s built-in locator application, to locate your phone on a map, force it to ring at its highest volume,
lock the device, display a message on the screen, or remotely erase all data from the device to protect your
privacy, which is called a remote wipe. See Figure 18-10. To use the locator app to locate your device or
perform a remote wipe, Find My Device must already be turned on using the Security screen in the Settings
app. Third-party locator applications are also available in the Play Store.

■ PIN code lock. Enter a numeric code with
numbers.
■ Password lock. Enter an alphanumeric code
with letters and/or numbers.
■ Pattern lock. Draw a pattern across a display of
dots on the screen.
■ Fingerprint lock. Use a specialized scanner
that collects an optical, electrical, or ultrasonic
reading of a person’s fingerprint and then
compares this information to stored data. The
fingerprint reader might be on the front or side
of the device (see Figure 18-11).
■ Facial recognition lock. Use the device’s
camera to perform facial recognition. A facial
lock requires a backup method, such as those
shown in Figure 18-12A, because facial recognition is not that secure—your device can be unlocked
when you look at it even if you didn’t intend to unlock it; someone who looks like you can unlock the
device; or someone can hold up the device in front of you to unlock it if your eyes are open.

Figure 18-12A shows screen lock options on an Android smartphone, including a pattern, fingerprint, and face
lock. Android also allows the user to set exceptions to the screen lock, as shown in Figure 18-12B. Using these
options, the smartphone might stay unlocked when it detects it’s being carried, when it detects its location, such as
the user’s home or office, or when another trusted device is nearby. Android calls this feature Smart Lock.

● Restrict failed login attempts. With Android
devices, login attempt restriction options vary by
manufacturer. With iOS, the device can be set to
erase all data after 10 failed passcode attempts. See
Figure 18-13. With each attempt, you must wait for
a longer time before you can try again. If the device
permanently locks and you’ve created a backup on
a Mac or in iTunes in Windows, you can sync to the
backup to access the phone. Otherwise, you’ll have
to use recovery mode, which erases the device.
Fingerprint and facial recognition are both forms of biometric authentication. Biometric authentication collects
biological data about a person’s fingerprints, handprints,
face, voice, retina, iris, and handwritten signatures to
confirm the person’s identity. In some states, you cannot
legally be forced to give your phone’s password to investigators, but you can be required to give your fingerprint.

Caution
If you set your device to erase data after repeated
failed login attempts, be sure to keep backups of your
data and other content. A small child could pick up
your smartphone and accidentally erase all your data
with just a few finger taps.
● Full device encryption. Both Android and iOS devices offer
device encryption, which encrypts all the stored data on a device.
Encrypting a device’s stored data makes it essentially useless to a
thief. However, encryption might slow down device performance,
and data is only as safe as the strength of the password keeping
the data encrypted. Also, data might be vulnerable again when
it’s being viewed or transmitted because device encryption only
encrypts data while it’s at rest or stored on the device, not when
it’s in motion or being transmitted.
Most Android devices are encrypted by default. To know if
the device is encrypted, look in Settings, tap Security, and then
Encryption & credentials (see Figure 18-14). For iPhones and
iPads, data is encrypted whenever the device is secured with a
passcode. Notice, near the bottom of Figure 18-13, Data protection
is enabled, which indicates that all data is encrypted.
Use Trusted Sources for Apps
Core 2 Objective 2.7
iOS devices are limited to installing apps only from Apple’s App Store. Android
devices can download and install apps from other sources, only some of
which are trustworthy. Trusted sources generally include Google Play
Store (play.google.com) and other well-known app stores, such as Amazon

Appstore for Android (amazon.com/appstore), SlideME (slideme.org), your
bank’s website, your employer, or your school. Before downloading an app,
look for lots of reviewer feedback as one measure of safety.
To reduce the threat of apps from untrusted sources, Android requires you
to first proactively allow apps from untrusted sources before you can download
and install them. To do that, go to Settings, Apps & notifications, Advanced,
Special app access, and Install unknown apps (see Figure 18-15). Select an
app, and choose Allow from this source. If you decide to use third-party app
sources, be sure you already have a good anti-malware program and a firewall
running on your device.
One reason you might want to install an app from an unknown source is
when you’re developing and testing an app not yet ready for distribution. An
Android app developed using Android Studio is compiled into a collection of
software files called an Android package (APK), sometimes called an Android
package kit, and the APK file has an .apk file extension. When you download
an app from Google Play, you download an .apk file, and then Android installs
the app on your device. In addition, you can download and install .apk files
from any source when your device is set to allow this, a process called sideloading the app.
Security Threats in Developer Mode
You can use Developer mode on your Android device to test and debug
apps you are building. Android hides Developer mode by default. To enable
it, go to Settings, About phone, and tap Build number seven times. To see
the Developer screen, in Settings, go to System, Advanced, and Developer
options. Notice on the Developer options screen (see Figure 18-16) you can
turn Developer options on or off and set many functions in Android designed
to test and debug apps.
Users sometimes turn on Developer mode so they can use an option, such
as Force 4x MSAA to improve image quality in a game or enable USB Debugging
so a backup app or other type of app on their computer can interface with the
Android device over a USB connection. This last option might pose a security
threat if an app on the computer is malicious.
Security Threats from Root Access, Jailbreaking,
and Bootlegged Apps
To get more control over what can be done with an Android or iOS device,
including downloading and installing bootlegged apps (illegal apps), some
users have discovered they can get root or administrative privileges to the
OS and the entire file system (all files and folders), and complete access
to all commands and features. For Android, the process is called rooting,
and for iOS, the process is called jailbreaking. After jailbreaking, an iOS
phone can get apps from any source, but Apple has the right to void the
warranty or refuse to provide support. Rooting and jailbreaking might also
violate BYOD policies in an enterprise environment. In addition, rooting
or jailbreaking makes a device more susceptible to malicious apps and
hackers using a technique called application spoofing to present to a user
an app pretending to be a legitimate app the user wants when, in fact, it
is malicious.

Mobile Security in Corporate Environments
Core 2 Objectives 2.1, 2.7
Recall from the Core 1 module “Supporting Mobile Devices” that corporations and schools might provide corporateowned devices, which are secured and managed by corporate policies and procedures, or the organization might
have BYOD policies and procedures that allow an employee or student to connect their own device to the corporate
network.
Regardless of who owns the device, mobile
device management (MDM) software downloads and
enforces a security profile to the device before allowing it to connect to the network. A security profile,
sometimes called a work profile, is a set of policies
and procedures to restrict how a user can access,
create, and edit the organization’s resources. Profile
security requirements can include full device encryption, backups, remote wipes, location apps, access
control, authenticator apps, multifactor authentication, firewalls, anti-malware measures, and use of
VPN connections. All requirements must be clearly
outlined with assurance that devices continue to
meet the baseline requirements, and users must be
educated on how to use them.
Rooting and Jailbreaking
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 3.5
Here is how you can tell if a device is rooted or jailbroken:
● Rooted Android device. Use one of these methods to find out if an Android device has been rooted:
■ Download and run a root checker app from Google Play; this will tell you if the device is rooted.
■ Download and run a terminal window app from Google Play. (A terminal window in Linux is similar
to a command prompt window in Windows.) When you open the app, look at the command prompt.
If the prompt is a #, the device is rooted. If the prompt is a $, the device is likely not rooted. With the
$ prompt showing, enter the sudo su root command, which in Linux allows you root access. If the
prompt changes to #, the device is rooted.
● Jailbroken iOS device. To find out if an iOS device has been jailbroken, look for an unusual app on the
home screen—for example, the Electra, Meridian, Cydia, or Sileo app. If any of these apps is present, the
device has been jailbroken. If you have any
app icon on your home screen that is not
available in the App Store, the app is most
likely a jailbreak app or other malware.
When you update iOS or perform a factory
reset, the jailbreak will be removed. How
to do that is covered later in the module.
Applying Concepts
To find out if an Android device has a corporate security
profile installed, open Settings, go to Accounts, and look
for a Work section. A passcode is required to access the
section. If you don’t see a Work section, the device does
not have a security profile installed. When the device has
a security profile, you must enter a passcode to access
the profile or enter one to access corporate apps on the
device. A corporate app has a briefcase icon.
After an iOS device receives the download from the
MDM server, apps on the device that belong to the corporation, called managed apps, are accessed via a passcode.
Note 5
In Linux, the # command prompt displays when a user
has root access, and the $ command prompt displays
when a user does not.

Although Google and Apple offer free or inexpensive backup services for their OSs, security profiles might
require installing a remote backup application, which remotely backs up the device’s data to the company’s secured
cloud storage. These apps might also sync files both directions and provide support for larger files. For example,
Acronis Cyper Backup (acronis.com) provides enterprise-level backups for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android
devices.
Troubleshooting Mobile Devices
Core 2 Objectives 3.4, 3.5
When learning to troubleshoot any OS or device, remember the web is a great source of information. Depend on the
support.google.com/googleplay and support.apple.com websites to give you troubleshooting tips and procedures for
their respective mobile devices. In this section, we’ll first explore troubleshooting tools for mobile device OSs, and
then we’ll consider several common symptoms and problems and what to do about them.
Troubleshooting Techniques
Core 2 Objectives 3.4, 3.5
In the Core 1 module “Supporting Mobile Devices,” you learned several techniques for troubleshooting mobile
devices. In this module, we review these techniques and add some more. The following steps are ordered to solve
a problem while making the fewest changes to the system (i.e., try the least
invasive solution first). Try the first step; if it does not solve the problem, move
on to the next step. With each step, first make sure the device is plugged in
or already has sufficient charge to complete the step. After you try one step,
check to see if the problem is solved before you move on to the next step. Here
are the general steps we’re following, although some might not be possible,
depending on the situation:
1. Close, uninstall, and reinstall an app. If you suspect an app is causing
a problem, uninstall it and use the app store to reinstall it.
2. Restart the device (also called a soft boot). Recall to restart an
Android device, press and hold the power button, and select Restart.
See Figure 18-17. To restart an Apple device, press and hold the side or
top button, and slide the power-off message to the right.
3. Reboot the device (also called a hard boot). For most Android
devices, hold down the power button to see the menu shown in Figure
18-17, and tap Power off twice. If that doesn’t work, try holding down
the power button and the volume-down button at the same time.
(Check Android device manufacturers for details.) To reboot an iPhone
or iPad, hold down the side or top button and the volume-down button
at the same time until the Apple logo appears. (For older iPhones and
iPads, press and hold the side or top button and the Home button.)
4. Update, repair, or reinstall the OS, or recover the system from the last
backup.
5. Start over by resetting the device to its factory state (all data and
settings are lost).
Let’s look at the last two steps in a little more detail. For more specific
instructions, search the website of the device manufacturer.

If the device has a removable battery and it refuses to hard boot, you can open the back of the device and then remove
and reinstall the battery as a last resort (unless the device is under warranty).
Note 6
Update, Repair, or Restore the System
As you progress through troubleshooting steps, try these options to update, repair, or restore a device:
1. Back up content and settings. Before you try any of the techniques in this section, first try to back up
data and settings using one or more of the methods discussed earlier in the module.
2. Update the OS. Try installing any updates, if available.
For Android devices, you can try these options to repair and restore your system:
1. Boot into Android Safe Mode. Similar to Windows computers, Android offers a Safe Mode for
troubleshooting. In Safe Mode, only the original software installed on the phone will run so that you
can eliminate third-party software as the source of the problem. However, be aware that booting to Safe
Mode might result in the loss of some settings, such as synched accounts. The combination of buttons
to access Safe Mode varies by device, so see the manufacturer’s website for specific instructions.
For Google’s Pixel smartphone, you access Safe Mode by holding down the power button until the
power menu appears. Tap and hold the Power Off option until the pop-up shown in Figure 18-18A
appears. Tap OK to restart the phone in Safe Mode, as shown in Figure 18-18B. Notice the Safe mode
flag at the bottom of the screen. In Safe Mode, only apps native to the Android installation can run, and
troubleshooting tools can be accessed through the Settings app to back up data, test configuration
issues, or reset the device. To exit Safe Mode, restart the phone normally.

2. Restore from backup. If you have used Google Drive or a third-party app to back up the Android OS, its
data or settings, now is the time to restore the system from this backup.

Several troubleshooting apps have been developed to help resolve
Android problems. Most of these apps work only if they have already been
installed before the problem occurs. If you have not already installed a
troubleshooting app, your best resource at this point is to do a Google
search on the problem and depend as much as possible on the device
manufacturer’s website.
For iOS devices, you have several options for repairing and restoring
your system, which are listed beginning with the least invasive:
1. Reset all iOS settings. To erase settings, open the Settings
app and tap General and then Reset. On the Reset screen (see
Figure 18-19), tap Reset All Settings.
2. Restore from backup. Use one of these methods to restore from
backup:
● Restore the device from iCloud. If you have an iCloud backup,
open the Settings app and tap General, Reset, and Erase All
Content and Settings (see Figure 18-19). Then tap Restore and
iCloud backup. You’ll need to sign in to iCloud.
● Restore the device from a Mac or from iTunes in Windows.
If you have used a Mac or iTunes in Windows to back up the
device, connect the device to your computer, start Finder on the Mac or iTunes in Windows, and click
Restore iPhone. Refer back to Figure 18-6.
3. Reinstall iOS. If an iOS device won’t turn on or start up, first consider that the battery might be dead.
Try to charge it for at least an hour. If you still can’t turn it on, you can use a Mac or iTunes in Windows
to try to reinstall iOS without losing your data. (You can use any Mac or iTunes on any Windows
computer, even if you have not previously used it to back up your device.)
a. If necessary, download and install iTunes. Make sure iTunes is updated, and then close it.
b. Connect the iPhone or iPad to the computer and start the Mac Finder or iTunes in Windows. Check
the Apple website (support.apple.com) for the correct keys to press to put the device in Recovery

Start Over with a Factory Reset
As a last resort, you can perform a factory reset. The reset erases all data and settings and resets the device to its
original factory default state. You can then apply a backup if you have one, so try to back up all data and settings
before performing the reset, if possible. Here are your options:
● Factory reset from the Settings app. In Android, open the Settings app, tap System, tap Advanced, tap Reset
options, and then tap Erase all data (factory reset). In iOS, open the Settings app, and then tap General and
Reset. On the Reset screen, tap Erase All Content and Settings.
● Factory reset from a hard boot (Android only). If you cannot start Android or cannot get to the Settings
app after a reboot, you can perform a factory reset from a hard boot. For most Android devices, hold down
the power button and volume-down button at the same time until you see the Android bootloader menu.
Select Recovery Mode, and then check the device manufacturer’s website for other options on the Recovery
Mode screen that you can try before a full factory reset. If you decide that you have no other options, select
Factory reset on the Recovery Mode screen.
● Factory reset and restore from a Mac or iTunes backup (iOS only). If an iOS device won’t turn on and
you’ve already tried to reinstall iOS using a Mac or iTunes in Windows, as discussed earlier, you can use
the computer to perform a factory reset. Connect the device to a Mac or Windows computer with iTunes
installed, and then put the device in Recovery Mode, as you learned to do earlier. Then click Restore (see
Figure 18-20B). All data and settings on the device are erased, and iOS is reinstalled. If you have previously
used this computer to back up your device, the device is restored from the backup. If you have an iCloud
backup, you will be given the opportunity to restore from iCloud the first time you sign on to the device
with your Apple ID.
If you have backed up to iCloud and you sign into iOS for the first time with your Apple ID on a new or factory reset
device, you are given the chance to restore the device from the iCloud backup.
Note 7
If you’ve tried the previous steps and your device is still not working properly, search for more troubleshooting
tips online, review the list of common problems in the next section, or take the device to the place of purchase for
repair.
Common Problems and Solutions
Core 2 Objective 3.4
Several common problems with mobile devices can be addressed with a little understanding of what has gone wrong
behind the scenes. Here’s a description of how to handle some common problems:
● Short battery life or power drain. Too many apps or malware running in the background will drain the
battery quickly, as will Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other wireless technologies. Disable wireless connections and
close apps when you’re not using them to save battery juice. Consider that malware might be at work. If the
battery charge still lasts an extremely short time, try exchanging the charger cable. If that doesn’t work,
exchange the battery unless the device is under warranty. Many Android devices have replaceable batteries,
so if a battery is performing poorly, consider replacing it.
How to deal with malware on mobile devices is covered in the Core 1 module “Supporting Mobile Devices.”

● Screen does not autorotate. Try these things:
■ In the Android Settings app, check the Display screen to verify auto-rotate is turned on (see
Figure 18-21A).
■ For Apple devices, swipe from the upper-right corner to open the Control Center (see Figure 18-21B),
and check the auto-rotate button.
■ Don’t touch the screen when you’re rotating it.
■ Update the OS, and restart the device.
■ If you recently installed a third-party app when the touch screen became unresponsive, try uninstalling
that app. Sometimes third-party apps can cause a touch screen to freeze.

● OS fails to update. Try these things:
■ The OS might fail to update if there’s not enough free space on the device to download and install
the update. The Settings app on an Android device displays how much storage space is available
(see Figure 18-22A) and what content can be removed (see Figure 18-22B). If free space is needed, try
uninstalling some unneeded apps or moving some data to the cloud.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
■ Make sure the battery is charged and the network connection is good.
■ Try a different network. Restart the device, and try again.
■ For iOS, you can try removing a failed update and updating the OS again. To remove an update, go to
Settings, General, and iPhone Storage; tap the update; and tap Delete Update. Then try the update
again. To use iTunes to update the OS, plug in the Apple device to your computer, open iTunes
in Windows or Finder on a Mac, locate your device, and click Check for Updates. Refer back to
Figure 18-6.
● Apps fail to launch or are slow to respond. Check and try these things:
■ When apps are slow to respond, slow to launch, or won’t launch at all, a hot or failing battery might
be the problem. Having too many apps open at once will use up memory, which can also slow down
overall performance. Close apps you’re not using, clean cached data, and disable live wallpapers.
■ Try to update the app, or uninstall it and install it again.
■ The device might be short on storage space; uninstall unused apps and delete files that are no longer
needed.
■ Consider downloading an app to clean up storage space or monitor how apps are using memory.
■ Consider performing a factory reset, and start over by installing only the apps you actually use.
● Apps crash, fail to close, or fail to update. Apps might crash or fail to close or update when an app is corrupted, storage is low, or the Wi-Fi network or cellular signal is slow or unstable. Try these things:
■ Free up some storage, and try a different network.
■ Make sure the OS is up to date.
■ For Android apps failing to update, try clearing the Google cache: In Settings, go to Apps &
notifications, Google, and Storage & cache, and tap CLEAR CACHE. See Figure 18-23. If the problem
persists, force stop the Google app.

● Random reboots. Random reboots are usually caused by
bad apps, overheating, corrupted OS, or defective hardware. First try uninstalling any suspected apps and updating the OS. For Android, go to the Play Store, and update all
apps: Tap your profile icon, tap Manage apps & device and
Update all. For iOS, in Settings, tap App Store and turn on
App Updates.

How to deal with overheating is covered in the Core 1 module
“Supporting Mobile Devices.”
Core to Core
Figure 18-24 This LG phone lists
several options for
applying updates
● Signal drop/weak signal. Sometimes updating the device’s
firmware can solve problems with dropped calls or network
connections due to a weak signal because the update might
apply to the radio firmware, which manages the cellular,
Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth radios. This is sometimes referred to
as a baseband update. For most of today’s mobile devices,
firmware updates are pushed out by the manufacturer at the
same time as OS updates. If your device allows for managing firmware updates separately, that option will usually be
available in the Settings app (see Figure 18-24) in the same
place as the OS update option. You might also be able to
download firmware updates directly from the device manufacturer (for example, for LG devices, go to lg.com/us/support/software-firmware-drivers). Be careful when applying
a firmware update because a failed update can “brick” the
device, which means to make it useless.
● System lockout. If a device is locked because of too
many failed attempts to sign in (such as when a child has
attempted to unlock your device or you have forgotten the
passcode), wait until the timer on the device counts down,
and try to sign in again. With Android devices, you might
also be able to sign in using your Google account and the
password associated with the device. After you have entered
the account and password, you must reset your passcode
or screen swipe pattern. If you still can’t unlock the device,
know that Google offers many solutions to this problem. Go
to accounts.google.com, and search for additional methods
and tools to unlock your device.

If you have forgotten the passcode for an iOS device, Apple advises that your only solution is to reset
the device, which erases all data and settings, and then restore the device from a backup. You can restore
from a backup stored on your computer or from iCloud.

Module Summary
Backing Up Mobile Devices
● Currently, the most popular operating systems used on mobile devices are Android by Google and iOS and
iPadOS by Apple.
● A mobile OS can be updated until it ages out of manufacturer updates based on end-of-life (EOL) limitations.
● Mobile apps are usually developed using development tools provided by Google and Apple in a software
development kit (SDK).
● Backups for mobile data include file-level backups and full and partial image-level backups, which can be
made to a local computer or to the cloud.
Securing Mobile Devices
● Secure mobile device data and resources by regularly updating and patching the OS, using an anti-malware
app with the Android OS, implementing a firewall, configuring a locator app and the ability to remote wipe
the device, and getting apps only from trusted sources.
● Control access to a mobile device by restricting failed login attempts, encrypting the device, and configuring a screen lock, such as a swipe lock, PIN lock, passcode lock, pattern lock, fingerprint lock, or face lock.
● Allowing root access to an Android device or jailbreaking an Apple device can expose the device to bootlegged apps, spoofing apps, or apps from untrustworthy sources.
● In corporate environments, a security profile might require the use of full device encryption, remote backups, remote wipes, access control to the device, authenticator apps, multifactor authentication, firewalls,
anti-malware measures, and VPN connections to protect company resources on the mobile device.
Troubleshooting Mobile Devices
● To troubleshoot a mobile device using tools in the OS, you can close running apps, uninstall and reinstall
an app, restart or reboot the device, update the OS, reset all settings (iOS only), use Safe Mode (Android
only), use Recovery Mode and restore from backup, or perform a factory reset.
● To address specific, common symptoms on a mobile device, you might need to replace the battery if it’s
not under warranty, adjust device settings, update the OS, uninstall or update problem apps, free up space
on the device, clear the Google cache, update firmware, reset the device, or consult with tech support for
the device manufacturer or app.
● Symptoms of malware on mobile devices include excessive power drain, slow performance, slow data
speeds, high network traffic, leaked personal files or data, data transmission over limits, strange text messages or phone calls, signal drops, weak signal, unintended Wi-Fi connections, unintended Bluetooth pairing,
unauthorized account access, unauthorized location tracking, and unauthorized camera or microphone
activation.

Hands-On Projects
Researching Apps for Mobile Payment Services
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.7
iPhone and Android phones both offer a mobile payment service, which allows you to use your smartphone to
pay for merchandise or services at a retail checkout counter. iPhone has Apple Pay, and Android uses Google Pay.
Mobile payment services rely on NFC (near-field communication) technology to exchange financial information
between your phone and the reader at the checkout counter. You might want to pay with a credit card stored on
your phone or get discounts with a store rewards account reported by your phone as you check out. But how secure
is your sensitive financial information?
Research the following topics, and answer the following questions:
1. Research how mobile payment systems use NFC technology. How can you activate NFC on an Android
phone for making a payment with Google Pay? On an iPhone for making a payment with Apple Pay?
2. Find and read some articles online or watch videos that describe the details of storing financial information
for mobile payment systems, accessing the information when needed, and transmitting the information
securely. What security measures are in place? Where is the data actually stored? What information is
actually transmitted at the point of transaction?
3. List three third-party mobile payment apps available either in Apple’s App Store or in Google’s Play Store.
On which mobile OS versions will the apps work? What are advantages and disadvantages of each app? How
much do the apps cost? What security measures do the apps use?
4. If you were to purchase one of these apps, which one would it be? Why?
Hands-On Project 18-1
Practicing Locating Your iOS or Android Device
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 2.7
Whether you have an Android device or an iOS device, knowing how to locate it when it gets lost or stolen and
knowing how to perform a remote wipe can be crucial skills in an emergency. Using your own device or a friend’s,
complete the following steps to find out how these tasks work:
1. If you have an iOS device, go to iCloud.com/find. If you have an Android device, go to google.com/android/find.
2. Sign in, and make sure the correct device is selected. Was the website able to locate your device? If not,
check your device settings and make any adjustments necessary until the website successfully locates the
device.
3. Explore the site to see how to make the device ring, how to lock the device, and how to erase the device.
What did you learn about your device?
One potential snag in finding or remotely wiping your device would be relying on passwords stored in your
device to access your Google or iCloud account. Be sure to store your sign-in information for these accounts in
password vault software or memorize the information.

Introduction
In previous modules, you have learned much about networking, including concepts related to TCP/IP networking,
managing network cabling and hardware, setting up a local network, network connections to the Internet, managing and securing resources on a network, virtual networks, and cloud computing. This module takes you one step
closer to being able to provide comprehensive support for networks and their administration. In this module, you
learn how to secure a workstation on a network, how to use a SOHO router to secure a LAN—including how to use
wireless security protocols and authentication methods to secure a wired or wireless network—how to use and
secure remote access technologies, and how to troubleshoot when networks don’t work as expected. By the time
you complete this module and its related lab activities, it is our hope that you will feel confident that you are ready
to begin your IT career as an apprentice to a network administrator.
Securing Workstations and IoT Devices
on a Network
Core 2 Objectives 1.4, 1.6, 2.5, 2.7, 2.10, 4.9
In this section of the module, we focus on securing a workstation that is connected to a local network. You learn
how to secure Windows Microsoft Edge and other browsers, how to set up a VPN connection so a computer can
securely connect to resources on a remote network, and how to configure a personal firewall for optimum security.
You also learn about securing IoT devices connected
to the Internet. Figure 19-1 To turn on browser syncing, you must

Secure a Browser
Core 2 Objectives 1.4, 2.10
In the discussion about securing browsers that
follows, we show examples of either Google Chrome,
currently the most popular browser, or Microsoft
Edge, the default browser in Windows 10/11. However,
know that each browser supports all the functions
listed, as do most popular browsers. Do the following
to secure Chrome or Edge browsers:
●● Sign in to a browser and sync data across
devices. Browser syncing is a service offered
by Google, Microsoft, and other browser
developers to sync browser settings and data
across each installation of the browser on
multiple devices. For Google Chrome, in the
Chrome browser, click the profile icon in the
upper-right corner (see Figure 19-1). When
you click Turn on sync, you will be prompted
to sign in to your Google account.

Although browser syncing is a convenience and might be appropriate in some situations, best practice for security is
to not sign in to a browser and not turn on browser syncing.
Note 1
Figure 19-2 Use Microsoft Edge settings to manage Edge profile settings, including passwords
Access Edge settings
●● Manage extensions and plug-ins. Browser plug-ins and extensions are small programs that install in a
browser to change the way the browser functions or to enhance the features of a single website, such as the
Cisco Webex Extension shown in Figure 19-3. A user might unintentionally install an extension or plug-in into
their browser. For example, the Easy 2 Convert 4 Me plug-in shown in Figure 19-3 was accidentally installed
in Google Chrome and works to display pop-up ads and redirect webpages. To remove the extension, go to
Chrome settings by clicking the three-dot menu icon in the upper-right corner of the Chrome window (as
shown in Figure 19-1). In settings, click Extensions in the left pane. A list of extensions appears, as shown
in Figure 19-3. Click Remove in the extensions box to delete it.
For Edge syncing, go to Edge settings by clicking the settings clog in the left panel of the Edge window
(see Figure 19-2). Select Profiles, and sign in to the browser. Edge will ask if you want to sync across all
your signed-in devices.

Before installing an extension or plug-in, verify it comes from a trusted source. Read reviews about it,
and install it only from the trusted source website, not from other untrusted sources on the web that might
have altered the original software or embedded malware in the download.
●● Password manager. To control how Edge manages passwords, in Edge settings, select Profiles and Passwords. (Refer back to Figure 19-2.) In the Passwords pane you can turn on or off saving passwords, decide
how passwords are managed, and copy, edit, or delete passwords saved by Edge.
●● Pop-up blocker and ad blockers. In Edge settings, select Cookies and site permissions and then Ads or
Pop-ups and redirects to turn on or off pop-ups, redirects, and intrusive or misleading ads.
●● Clear the cache and all browsing data. In Edge settings, select Privacy, search, and services. Use the Tracking prevention area on this page to manage trackers used by Microsoft and other websites that collect and
use information about your browsing habits. In the Clear browsing data area of the page, you can choose
to clear your browsing data at any time. Select Choose what to clear every time you close the browser
to see the page shown in Figure 19-4, where you can decide to clear cached images and files and all other
browser data each time you close the browser. Clearing all data about you each time you close the browser
is a suggested best practice to secure a browser.

●● Privacy browsing. In Edge settings, select Privacy, search, and services and use options in the Privacy
area (see Figure 19-5) to send “Do Not Track” requests to websites you visit. Microsoft and Google say that
even though you might send this request to a website, it does not guarantee that the website will honor
the request.
●● Secure connections and sites and valid certificates. When browsers use HTTPS and SSL encryption protocols to communicate with secured websites, they validate a website’s digital certificate. To view and manage
these certificates, in Chrome settings, select Privacy and security, and click Manage certificates. In Edge
settings, click Privacy, search, and services and then click Manage certificates. In both cases, the Windows
Certificate dialog box appears where you can view, remove, import, and export certificates. See Figure 19-6.

Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to know how to secure browsers, including how to manage passwords, pop-up blockers, clearing the cache, private-browsing modes, browser data synchronization, and ad blockers. You also need to know
how to download browsers from only trusted sources using hashing techniques (described later in this module) and
how to configure proxy servers using the Windows Internet Options dialog box.
●● Update or repair Edge. If you have a problem with Microsoft Edge, to update it, in Edge settings, click
About Microsoft Edge. The update begins immediately. To repair Edge, use the Apps & features page in
the Windows Settings app.
Internet Options and Proxy Settings
Windows 10 offers two browsers: the newer Edge and the older Internet Explorer browsers. Windows 11 offers only
the Edge browser, but for legacy websites that require Internet Explorer, you can enable IE Mode in Edge. Internet
Explorer in Windows 10 is configured via the Internet Options applet in Control Panel. For both Windows 10 and
Windows 11, a few settings in Internet Options also affect Edge and other browsers installed in the system, including proxy settings.
Many large corporations and ISPs use proxy servers to speed up Internet access. A web browser does not have
to be aware that a proxy server is in use. However, one reason you might need to configure Internet Options and use
a proxy server is when you are on a corporate network and are having a problem connecting to a secured website
(one using HTTP over SSL or another encryption protocol). The problem might be caused by Windows trying to
connect using the wrong proxy server on the network. Check with your network administrator to find out if a specific
proxy server should be used to manage secure website connections.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
If you need to configure Internet Options to use a specific proxy server, open Control Panel in classic view, and
then open Internet Options. On the Connections tab, click LAN settings. In the settings dialog box, check Use a
proxy server for your LAN, and enter the IP address of the proxy server (see Figure 19-7). If your organization uses
more than one proxy server, click Advanced, and enter IP addresses for each type of proxy server on your network
(see the right side of Figure 19-7). You can also enter a port address for each server, if necessary. If you are trying
to solve a problem of connecting to a server using HTTP over SSL or another secured protocol, use the Secure field
to enter the IP address of the proxy server that is used to manage secure connections.
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to know how to configure proxy settings on a client desktop. For Windows 10/11, this
is done with Internet Options.
Figure 19-7 Configure Microsoft Edge and other installed browsers to use one or more proxy servers
Click to use a
proxy server
Enter IP address
of the proxy server
When you configure a proxy server in Internet Options, the setting applies to the entire Windows system, including Edge, Chrome, and other browsers and apps that can use a proxy server. If you want to use a proxy server just
for a particular browser, know that Chrome, Edge, and Windows 10 Internet Explorer don’t support customizing a
proxy setting, but the Firefox browser (mozilla.org) can use either proxy servers set up in Internet Options for the
entire system or a customized proxy configured in Firefox.
Downloading Browsers Securely
When you download a new browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, be sure to download only from a trusted source.
To verify the download is genuine, the software to install it that downloads with the browser file might be digitally
signed. In addition, you can verify the download is error-free by comparing hashes. A hash, sometimes called a
checksum, is a value generated by applying a specific algorithm to a file or text string. If the browser developer
provides a hash value for the file before it is downloaded, you can compare the two values. If the two hash values
match, you know the download happened without errors.

Types of hashing algorithms are MD5, which is mostly used for small files and produces a 128-bit hash value,
and SHA-1 and SHA-2, used for larger files. SHA-2 hashing produces a 224-, 256-, 384-, or 512-bit hash value. Here are
the general steps to use hashing to verify that a file downloads with no errors:
1. You need a hash generator program, which can install as an extension in your browser. For example,
for Google Chrome, go to the Chrome Web Store (chrome.google.com/webstore), and search for a hash
generator. Select your generator, and add it as a Chrome extension. It creates a tab in the browser menu
bar, as shown in Figure 19-8A.
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to be able to use hashing when verifying that a browser download was successful.
However, in practice, very few browser developers provide hash values for their browser installation files. Other types
of software developers do routinely provide hash values to verify their downloaded files, and you can use hashing to
verify these downloads. When a developer provides a hash value for a file, you might see the value displayed beside
the download link on the download page. See Figure 19-9.

2. Download the file, and obtain the hash value provided by the file developer.
3. Copy the path to the file. (In Explorer, select the file, click Home, and then click Copy path.) For the
Hash Generator extension in Google Chrome, open the extension box, paste the path to the file in the
box, select the hash algorithm (be sure to select the same algorithm the developer used), and click
Generate. The hash displays (see Figure 19-8B), and you can then select and copy it.
4. Compare the hash value you generated to the one the developer provided. If they match, the download
was without errors.

Create a VPN Connection
Core 2 Objectives 1.6, 4.9
A virtual private network (VPN) is often used by telecommuting employees to connect to the corporate network
by way of the Internet. A VPN protects data by encrypting it from the time it leaves the remote computer until it
reaches a server on the corporate network, and vice versa. The encryption technique is called a tunnel or tunneling
(see Figure 19-10). Encryption protocols used with a VPN include SSL, TLS, OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec, L2TP/IPsec, SSTP,
and WireGuard. Managed switches, which you learned about in the Core 1 module “Network Infrastructure and Cloud
Computing,” sometimes provide VPN servers embedded in their firmware so they can support VPN connections for
remote users of the private network to which they belong.
Figure 19-10 A VPN connection secures all traffic between the VPN client and the
VPN server on the private network
VPN client
Internet
Firewall
Private network
VPN server
A VPN can be managed by operating systems, routers, or third-party software such as OpenVPN (openvpn.net)
or NordVPN (nordvpn.com). A VPN connection is a virtual connection, which means you are setting up the tunnel
over an existing connection to the Internet. When creating a VPN connection on a personal computer, always follow
directions given by the network administrator who hosts the VPN. The company website might provide VPN client
software to download and install on your computer. For example, NordVPN provides an app to install on the client
computer. Then you might be expected to double-click a configuration file to complete the VPN connection. OpenVPN
uses an .ovpn file for this purpose.
Here are the general steps using Windows 10/11 to connect to a VPN:
1. You can set up a VPN connection beginning from the Internet Options dialog box or from the Network
and Sharing Center. To open the Network and Sharing Center, open Control Panel in classic view and
then click Network and Sharing Center (see Figure 19-11).

2. Click Set up a new connection or network. Then select Connect to a workplace and click Next.
3. In the Connect to a Workplace dialog box, click Use my Internet connection (VPN). In the next dialog
box, enter the IP address or domain name of the network (see Figure 19-12). Your network administrator
can provide this information. Name the VPN connection, and click Create.
Figure 19-12 Enter connection information to the VPN
Figure 19-13 Enter your user name and password
to connect to your VPN
Whenever you want to use the VPN connection,
click the Network icon in the taskbar. In the list of available networks, click the VPN connection, and then click
Connect. Enter your user name and password (see
Figure 19-13), and click OK. Your user name and password are likely to be the same network ID and password
to your user account on the Windows domain on the
corporate network.
After the connection is made, you can use your
browser to access the corporate secured intranet websites or other resources. The resources you can access
depend on the permissions assigned to your user account.
Problems connecting to a VPN can be caused by the
wrong authentication protocols being used when passing the user name and password to the VPN. To configure these settings, return to the Network and Sharing Center,
and click Change adapter settings. In the Network Connections window, right-click VPN Connection and click
Properties. In the Properties dialog box, select the Security tab (see Figure 19-14). Here you can select security
settings for the type of VPN, encryption requirements, and authentication protocols given to you by the network
administrator.

Core 2 Objectives 1.4, 1.6, 2.5
Recall from the Core 1 module “Networking Fundamentals” that a SOHO router can serve as a hardware firewall to
protect its network from attack over the Internet, and the best protection from attack is layered protection (see
Figure 19-17). In addition to a network hardware firewall, a large corporation might use a software firewall, also
called a corporate firewall, installed on a computer that stands between the Internet and the network to protect
the network. This computer has two network cards installed, and the installed software firewall filters the traffic
between the two cards.

A personal firewall, also called a host firewall or application firewall, is software installed on a personal computer to protect it. A personal firewall provides redundant protection from attacks over the Internet, filters inbound
traffic to protect a computer from attack from other computers on the same network, and filters outbound traffic to
prevent attacks on other computers on the same network. When setting up a SOHO network or a personal computer,
configure a personal firewall on each computer.
Windows Defender Firewall is a personal firewall that protects a computer from intrusion and from attacking
other computers; it is automatically configured when you set up your security level for a new network connection.
To set the security for a network connection, open the Network and Sharing Center in Control Panel, and click
Change advanced sharing settings. In the Windows 10/11 Advanced sharing settings window (see Figure 19-18), you
can choose private or public security levels and set other security options for the network connection. All these
settings affect settings in Windows Defender Firewall.

Configuring Windows Defender Firewall
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.4
You can use the Windows Defender Firewall window in Windows 10/11 to configure even more firewall settings.
As you work, be careful that you don’t accidentally change a setting that leaves your computer open to attack. Follow
these steps to find out more:
1. Open Control Panel in classic view, and click Windows Defender Firewall. See Figure 19-19.
2. In general, Windows Defender Firewall works by allowing or denying network traffic on incoming or
outgoing ports. Recall that a port is a number an application on the computer uses to connect to another
application on the network or Internet. Here are some basic settings you can configure in Windows
Defender Firewall:
a. Use the left pane to turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off. When the firewall is disabled (not a
good idea), all traffic is allowed to pass, and your computer is unprotected.
b. When the firewall is enabled, all traffic is stopped unless you have specified an exception. To allow
or deny a specific app access to the computer, click Allow an app or feature through Windows
Defender Firewall. You can then select the app from a list of apps and decide how it can use the
network connection.

c. To allow or deny all other types of traffic, not just those related to apps, click Advanced settings.
On the Advanced Security window (see Figure 19-20), you can click Inbound Rules or Outbound
Rules to create or edit an inbound or outbound rule and control traffic. A rule can specify how port
numbers, TCP/IP protocols, programs, services, computers, and remote users can use the network
connection. A rule can apply to public, private, and domain networks.
Now let’s turn our attention to securing other devices, including the Internet of Things devices.
Secure Internet of Things Devices
Core 2 Objective 2.7
For a device, such as a refrigerator or doorbell, to be considered part of the Internet of Things (IoT), the device or its
controller or bridge must have an IP address. After all, a node can’t connect to the Internet without an IP address. In
most cases, IoT devices are monitored and controlled by wireless connections. Besides Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, Z-Wave
and Zigbee are two other wireless communication protocols commonly used by smart locks, smart light bulbs, and
other IoT devices. Here are the primary facts about Z-Wave and Zigbee:
●● Z-Wave transmits around the 900 MHz band and requires less power than Wi-Fi. It has a larger range than
Bluetooth, reaching a range of up to 100 meters in open air (although significantly less inside buildings).
●● Zigbee operates in either the 2.4 GHz band or the 900 MHz band, requires less power than Wi-Fi, and generally reaches a range of about 20 meters inside, but it can reach much farther.

●● Z-Wave and Zigbee are not compatible. Zigbee is faster than Z-Wave. Z-Wave and Zigbee both use encryption
and are considered safe from hackers.
●● Both Z-Wave and Zigbee devices can connect in a mesh network, which means that devices can “hop”
through other devices to reach the destination device. Z-Wave and Zigbee devices are not normally assigned
IP addresses unless another protocol, such as Z/IP or Zigbee IP, is working to manage TCP/IP networking.
●● Typically, Zigbee and Z-Wave compete about equally for the wireless standard of choice for IoT devices in
the residential market. Zigbee is the choice for large-scale commercial or industrial use because it is more
robust.

When worker honeybees return to their nest, they do a dance that looks like a zig-zag pattern. Zigbee was named after
this phenomenon: zig bee.

Some smart devices, such as a smart thermostat by Nest (nest.com), can connect directly to a Wi-Fi network
via an embedded Wi-Fi radio (see Figure 19-21). Alternately, devices such as a door lock or thermostat might use
Bluetooth to communicate with a phone or tablet within Bluetooth range or might use a bridge to connect to the
Wi-Fi network. Other devices, such as smart light bulbs or a door lock, might use Zigbee, Z-Wave, or another wireless technology that the phone or tablet does not use. Such devices require a bridge device to connect them to the
Wi-Fi network, as shown in Figure 19-21.
For smart devices to truly be IoT devices, you must be able to control them over the Internet. For that to happen, they must connect directly or through a bridge to a home or business Wi-Fi network that has Internet access.
Notice in Figure 19-21 that the manufacturer’s website is involved when managing many IoT devices. For example,
Figure 19-22 shows the webpage where two exterior webcams, three interior webcams, and two thermostats by Nest
(nest.com) can be monitored and managed from anywhere on the web.

In the Core 1 module “Networking Fundamentals,” you learned to install and set up a SOHO router. This module takes
you one step further to learn how to secure the router and the local network it supports. If you have not yet read the
module “Networking Fundamentals,” now would be a good time to work your way through it and then turn back to
this module.
Core to Core
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 1 and A+ Core 2 exams both require you to be able to install and configure a SOHO wired and wireless
router. The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to be able to secure the router and SOHO network.
Here are some tips to secure IoT devices:
●● Avoid using public networks on the Internet when you’re monitoring or controlling IoT devices. If you must
use public networks, consider using a VPN connection.
●● Set up guest networks for your guests to use in your home or small business so your IoT devices are not
exposed.
●● For all IoT devices that have default user names and passwords, change the user names and create strong
passwords.
●● Don’t connect locks and security cameras to your voice assistant. You don’t want an intruder to yell through
the window, “Alexa, open the front door!”
●● Frequently purge the data kept by Amazon for Alexa and by Google for Google Assistant. You can use your
phone app to delete.
●● Keep software and firmware up to date to make sure security patches are current.
●● Implement the wireless security methods for your wireless router covered next.
Securing a Multifunction Router
for a SOHO Network
Core 2 Objectives 2.2, 2.5, 2.9
An IT support technician is likely to be called on to set up a small office or home office (SOHO) network. As part of
setting up a small network, you need to know how to set up and secure a multipurpose router to stand between the
network and the Internet. A router (see Figure 19-23) is a device that manages traffic between two or more networks
and can help find the best path for traffic to get from one network to another.

Here is a brief review of the functions of a SOHO router you learned about in the module “Networking
Fundamentals”:
●● As a router, it stands between two networks—the ISP network and the local network—and routes traffic
between the two networks.
●● As a switch, it manages several network ports that can be connected to wired devices on the local network.
●● As a DHCP server, it can provide IP addresses to computers and other devices on the local network.
●● As a wireless access point (WAP), it enables wireless devices to connect to the network. These wireless
connections can be secured using wireless security features.
●● As a firewall, it blocks unwanted traffic from the
Internet and can restrict Internet access for local
devices behind the firewall.
●● If an external storage device, such as a USB flash
drive or external hard drive, connects to the
router via the USB port, the router can be used
as a file server for network users.
An example of a multifunction router is the Nighthawk AC1900 by NETGEAR, shown in Figures 19-25 and
19-26. It has one Internet port (also called the WAN or
wide-area-network port) to connect to the ISP by way
of a modem or ONT and four ports for devices on the
network. The USB port can be used to plug in a USB
external hard drive for file sharing on the network.
The router is also a wireless access point with multiple
antennas to increase speed and range.
A SOHO router stands between the Internet and a small local network (LAN) to connect the LAN to a network
that belongs to an ISP, which connects to the Internet. See Figure 19-24.

Next, let’s step through the process of securing a SOHO router and the network it supports.
Router Placement for Best Security
Core 2 Objective 2.9
When securing a router, consider its physical security. If the router will be used as a wireless access point, make sure
it is centrally located to create the best Wi-Fi hotspot for users. For physical security in a small business, don’t place
the router in a public location, such as the lobby. For best security, place the router behind a locked door accessible
only to authorized personnel in a location with access to network cabling. The indoor range for a Wi-Fi hotspot is
up to 70 meters; this range is affected by many factors, including interference from walls, furniture, electrical equipment, and other nearby hotspots. For the best Wi-Fi strength, position your router or a stand-alone wireless access
point in the center of where you want your hotspot, and know that a higher position (near the ceiling) works better
than a lower position (on the floor).
For routers that have external antennas, raise the antennas to vertical positions. Plug in the router and connect
network cables to devices on the local network. Connect the network cable from the ISP modem or other device to
the uplink port on the router.
Basic Security Features of a Router
Core 2 Objectives 2.5, 2.9
To configure a router for the first time or change its configuration, always follow the directions of the manufacturer.
You can use any computer on the network that uses a wired connection (it doesn’t matter which computer) to configure the firmware on the router. You’ll need the IP address of the router and the default user name and password
to the router setup. To find this information, look in the router documentation or search online for your model and
brand of router.
Here are the general steps for one router, the ASUS RT-AX55. The setup screens for your router may be different:
1. Sign in to router. Open your browser, and enter the IP address of the router in the address box. In
our example, the address is 192.168.1.1. Enter the user name and password to the router firmware.
The router firmware main menu screen appears.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
3. Update firmware. Also notice in Figure 19-27 the Firmware Upgrade tab in the Administration group.
On this tab, you can check online for a firmware update and then download and install the update. If the
update fails while it is installing, you can manually download and install the ASUS Firmware Restoration
utility to undo the update.
Caution
Changing the router password is especially important if the router is a wireless router. Unless you have disabled or
secured the wireless access point, anyone within its range—even outside your building—can use your wireless network.
If they guess the default password to the router, they can change the password to hijack your router. Also, your wireless
network could be used for criminal activity.
Figure 19-27 Change the password to the router firmware configuration

Upgrade firmware
2. Change the default password. One important security setting is to change the default password to the
router firmware. For the ASUS router, click Administration in the left pane, and then click the System tab
to change the router name and password. See Figure 19-27.

5. DHCP reservations. Recall from the module “Networking Fundamentals” that you can set the local IP
address for the router, the subnet mask, and the range of IP addresses that the router’s DHCP server can
serve up to local hosts on the network. See Figure 19-29. In addition, you can reserve an IP address for
a host on the network, such as a printer, that requires a static IP address so other hosts on the network
can find it. In Figure 19-29, notice the Canon printer is assigned the static IP address 192.168.1.100. The
printer was initially identified by its MAC address, also shown in the figure.
4. Static wide-area network (WAN) IP address. Normally, the ISP serves up a dynamic IP address, subnet
mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses to the router for its connection to the ISP network.
However, if your local network publishes a website, email service, or other service on the Internet, the
router will need a static IP address configuration on the WAN so computers on the Internet can find
your network. For this purpose, you can lease a public IP address from the ISP or other source and
configure the router to use this static IP address. To configure this connection, for the ASUS router, click
WAN in the left pane, and in the Basic Config section, select Static IP as the WAN Connection Type (see
Figure 19-28). Enter the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses for the WAN
configuration.
Caution
After you make a change to the router firmware, be sure to click Apply at the bottom of the screen to save your changes
before you move on to another firmware screen.

Exam Tip
The A+ Core 1 and A+ Core 2 exams both require you to know about DHCP servers and how to reserve an IP address
for a host that requires a static IP address on the network.
6. Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Some devices—such as printers, mobile devices, and some smart
home IoT appliances—might be enabled for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), which allows them to
discover and communicate with each other on the network. Enable UPnP if devices on your network are
having a problem establishing communication. Basically, a device can then use the router to advertise
its service and automatically communicate with other devices on the network. UPnP is considered a
security risk because shields between devices are dropped, which hackers might exploit. Also, UPnP
increases chatter on the network and can affect performance. Therefore, use UPnP with caution. For our
sample router, UPnP is enabled in the WAN group, in the Basic Config section (refer back to Figure 19-28).
7. QoS for an application. As you use your network and notice that one application, such as VoIP, gaming,
or media streaming, is not getting the best service, you can improve its network performance using the
Quality of Service (QoS) feature discussed in earlier modules. For our sample router, click Adaptive QoS
in the left pane and the QoS tab in the right pane. Then turn on Enable QoS. See Figure 19-30. You can
then use the buttons near the bottom of this window to promote a type of application or click Customize
to further fine-tune which apps get priority with network bandwidth.

Now let’s look at the concepts and steps to put up a firewall to control traffic to and from your network and the
Internet. Then we’ll look at how to set up a wireless network.
Firewall Settings
Core 2 Objectives 2.5, 2.9
To protect resources on the network, a router’s firewall can examine each message coming from the Internet and
decide if the message is allowed onto the local network. When a message arrives at the router, it is directed to a
particular computer (identified by its IP address) and to a particular application running on that computer (identified by a port number, also called a port or port address.)
Recall that most applications used on the Internet or a local network are client/server applications. Client
applications—such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Outlook—communicate with server applications such as
a web server or email server. Each client and server application installed on a computer listens at a predetermined
port that uniquely identifies the application on the computer.
Suppose a computer with an IP address of 138.60.30.5 is running an email server listening at port 25 and a web
server application listening at port 80. If a client computer sends a request to 138.60.30.5:25 (IP address and port 25),
the email server listening at that port responds. On the other hand, if a request is sent to 138.60.30.5:80 (IP address
and port 80), the web server listening at port 80 responds (see Figure 19-31).

Firewalls on routers offer the option to disable (close) all ports, which means that no activity initiated from
the Internet can get in. For some routers, you must explicitly disable all ports. For the ASUS router in our example,
all ports are disabled (closed) by default. You must specify exceptions to this firewall rule in order to allow unsolicited traffic from the Internet. Exceptions are allowed using port forwarding or a DMZ (described later in this
module). In addition to managing ports, you can also limit Internet traffic by filtering content. All these techniques
are discussed next.
Port Forwarding
Suppose you’re hosting an Internet game or website or you want to use Remote Desktop to access your home computer from the Internet. In these situations, you need to enable (open) certain ports to certain computers so that
activity initiated from the Internet can get past your firewall. This technique, called port forwarding or port mapping,
means that when the firewall receives a request for communication from the Internet to the specific computer and
port, the request will be allowed and forwarded to that computer on the network. The computer is defined to the
router by its static IP address. For example, in Figure 19-32, port 80 is open and requests to port 80 are forwarded to
the web server listening at that port. This one computer on the network is the only one allowed to receive requests
at port 80.
For a refresher on how client/server applications use port addresses and the common ports they use, see the Core 1
module “Networking Fundamentals.”

2. To add a port forwarding rule, click Add profile. For a web server, in the box that appears, select HTTP
(80) as shown in Figure 19-34. The TCP protocol is selected automatically.
To configure port forwarding for our sample router, follow these steps:
1. In the router firmware, click WAN in the left pane, select the Virtual Server/Port Forwarding tab, and
turn on Enable Port Forwarding (see Figure 19-33).

If you want to use a domain name rather than an IP address to access a computer on your network from the Internet,
you’ll need to purchase the domain name and register it in the Internet namespace to associate it with your public
static IP address. Assign this public IP address to your router, which forwards requests to the web server behind the
firewall. Several websites on the Internet let you lease domain names and public IP addresses; one such site is by Network Solutions (networksolutions.com).
Note 3
3. In the dropdown list of internal IP addresses, select the IP address of the web server. Click OK.
4. Be sure to test your port forwarding rule by using a device connected to the Internet but not connected
to your LAN or router. Can the device reach your website?
Figure 19-34 Select the service that is to receive traffic from the Internet
Here are some tips to keep in mind when using port forwarding:
●● You must have a static IP address for the WAN side of your router so people on the Internet can find you.
Most ISPs will provide you a static IP address for an additional monthly fee, or you can lease one from
another source and inform your ISP about it.
●● For port forwarding to work, the computer on your network must have a static IP address so the router
knows where to send the communication.
●● Using port forwarding, your computer and network are more vulnerable because you are allowing external
users directly into your private network. For better security, turn on port forwarding only when you know
it’s being used and be sure to disable any unused ports you don’t need open.

DMZ and Screened Subnet
A DMZ (demilitarized zone) in networking is a computer or network that is not protected by a firewall or has limited
protection. You can drop all your shields protecting a computer by putting it in a DMZ, and the firewall will no longer
protect it. If you are having problems getting port forwarding to work, putting a computer in a DMZ can free it to
receive any communication from the Internet. All unsolicited traffic from the Internet that the router would normally
drop is forwarded to the computer designated as the DMZ server.
Caution
If a DMZ computer is compromised, it can be used to attack other computers on the network. Use it only as a last resort
when you cannot get port forwarding to work. It goes without saying you should not leave the DMZ enabled unless
you are using it.
Figure 19-35 Configure an unprotected DMZ computer exposed to the Internet
To set up a DMZ server for our sample router, click WAN in the left pane, click the DMZ tab, and enable the DMZ.
You can then enter the static IP address of the one computer you want to put in the DMZ. See Figure 19-35.
A screened subnet is a variation of a DMZ, and the two terms are often used interchangeably. As in the previous example, the computer labeled as computer A in Figure 19-36 is in the DMZ and is exposed to all Internet traffic.
Computer B is in the screened subnet and is partially protected by a firewall provided by the exterior router, sometimes called an access router. A second router, the interior router, protects another subnet containing computer C,
which is the most protected of all. In an organization, web servers and other servers that are exposed to unsolicited
Internet traffic are put in the screened subnet, which offers some protection, and all other computers are put in the
highly protected LAN. To reach these computers, traffic must make its way through two firewalls.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Content Filtering
Routers normally provide a way for employers or parents to limit the content that computers on the local network
can access on the Internet. Filtering can apply to specific computers, users, websites, categories of websites, keywords, services, time of day, and day of the week. Criteria for filtering can draw from blacklists (lists of what cannot
be accessed) or whitelists (lists of what can be accessed).
For our sample ASUS router, to manage content filtering, click Firewall in the left pane and the Keyword Filter
tab. In this window, you can enable keyword filtering, and then enter a list of key words. Unsecured webpages that
contain these key words will be blocked. Webpages that use HTTPS will not be filtered. See Figure 19-37.

Application and Port Security and IP Filtering
Firewalls block specific applications or network services, ports, and IP addresses. For the ASUS router, all this is
done in the Firewall group, on the Network Services Filter page (see Figure 19-38.) First enable network service
filtering, and then you can either deny or allow (deactivate or activate) the activity you specify. You can filter wellknown applications by name or filter other apps by the ports they use. For example, you can block Internet gaming
services, email services, or web services, or you can allow a service based on a schedule. You can also specify the
IP addresses of computers to which the block applies.
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 1 and A+ Core 2 exams may give a scenario that expects you to resolve a problem by implementing port
forwarding (mapping), whitelists, blacklists, content filtering, DMZ, screened subnets, application and port security,
and IP filtering.

Now let’s turn our attention to configuring a wireless access point provided by a router.
Securing a Wireless Network
Core 2 Objectives 2.2, 2.9
A wireless network is created by a wireless access point using the Wi-Fi standards. These Wi-Fi standards are technically the IEEE 802.11 standards—collectively known as the 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax standards—and have evolved over
the years. Table 19-1 lists older and current standards.
Standard Maximum Speed Description
802.11a Up to 54 Mbps No longer used. Used 5 GHz frequency with a range up to 50 meters.
802.11b Up to 11 Mbps Experiences interference from cordless phones and microwaves.
Used 2.4 GHz frequency and a range up to 100 meters.
802.11g Up to 54 Mbps Compatible with and has replaced 802.11b. Uses 2.4 GHz frequency
and range up to 100 meters.
802.11n (Wi-Fi 4) Up to 600 Mbps An access point can have up to four antennas to improve
performance. Uses both 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, with an indoor
range up to 70 meters and outdoor range up to 250 meters.
802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) Theoretically up to
7 Gbps, but currently
limited to 1.3 Gbps
Supports up to eight antennas and beamforming to increase signal
strength toward connected devices. Uses 5 GHz frequency only and
has the same ranges as 802.11n.
802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) Up to 10 Gbps This throughput is possible when using the 160 MHz channel spacing
and eight antennas. (Each antenna provides one spatial stream.)
Uses both 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies and has a range a bit better
than 802.11n/ac.

antennas supports

When configuring your wireless access point, it’s important you are connected to the router using a wired connection. If you change a wireless
setting and you are connected wirelessly, your wireless connection will be
dropped immediately, and you will not be able to continue configuring the
router until you connect again.
Note 4
Wireless computers and other devices on the wireless LAN (WLAN)
must support the latest wireless standard for that standard to be used. If
they do not, the connection uses the latest standard supported by both
the WAP and the client. Figure 19-39 shows a wireless adapter that has two
antennas and supports the 802.11ax standard. Most new adapters, wireless
computers, and mobile devices support 802.11ax and are backward compatible with older standards.
Now let’s look at the various features and settings of a wireless access
point needed to secure the wireless network.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Require a Security Key
The most common and effective method of securing a wireless network is to require a security key before a client
can connect to the network. By default, a network that uses a security key encrypts data traversing the network. Use
the router firmware to set the security key. For best security, enter a security key that is different from the password
for the router’s firmware utility.
When it comes to making secure passwords and passphrases, longer is better and randomness is crucial. To make the
strongest passphrase or security key, use a random group of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters and, if allowed,
at least one symbol. At the bare minimum, use at least eight characters in the passphrase.

For our sample router, to set the security keys, click Wireless in the left pane. On the General tab, notice the

Disable Guest Access
A SOHO router is likely to offer the option to set up guest networks. A guest network provides access to the Internet
but does not allow access to the local network. For our sample router, click Guest Network in the left pane to see
the setup shown in Figure 19-42. Using this window, you can configure up to three 2.4 GHz and three 5 GHz guest
networks. Best security practices recommend you not allow guest access and disable these guest networks.
Change the Default SSID and Disable SSID Broadcasting
The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is the name of a wireless network. Referring back to Figure 19-40, you can see that
each frequency band has its own SSID, and you can change that name. Each band is its own wireless network, which
is connected by the access point (router) to the local wired network. When you assign an SSID that includes 2.4 or
5 in the name (PandaBear5 in Figure 19-40), a user can more easily select the network using the 5 GHz band in order
to get the faster speeds.
Also notice in Figure 19-40 the option to Hide SSID, which disables SSID broadcasting. Doing so causes the
wireless network to appear as Unnamed or Unknown Network on an end user’s device. When a user selects this
network, they are given the opportunity to enter the SSID. If they don’t enter the name correctly, they will not be
able to connect. This security method is not considered strong because software can be used to discover an SSID
that is not being broadcast.
Select Channels for the WLAN
A channel is a specific radio frequency within a broader frequency. For example, two channels in the 2.4 GHz band
are 2.412 GHz and 2.437 GHz. In the United States, eleven channels are available for wireless communication in the
2.4 GHz band. In order to avoid channel overlap, however, devices in the 2.4 GHz band select channels 1, 6, or 11,
resulting in three nonoverlapping channels available for use. The 5 GHz band offers up to 24 nonoverlapping channels
in the United States, but some of those channels are restricted in certain areas, such as near an airport. For most
networks, you can allow auto channel selection so the device scans for the least busy channel. However, if you are
trying to solve a problem with interference from a nearby wireless network, you can manually set each network to a
different channel and make the channels far apart to reduce interference. For example, in the 2.4 GHz band, set the
network on one WAP to channel 1 and set a nearby WAP’s network to channel 11. For our sample router, the dropdown menu for channel selection in the 2.4 GHz band is shown in Figure 19-41. To allow the router to automatically
select the least busy channel, select Auto.

2.4 GHz range

Set Encryption
When you set a security key, routers by default encrypt wireless transmissions. You can change the encryption
protocols used or disable encryption. (Encrypting transmissions increases security but slows down the network;
disabling encryption can improve performance and might be appropriate when you are not concerned about transmissions being hacked.) The three main security standards for 802.11 wireless networks are as follows:
●● WPA. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is an older encryption standard and typically uses TKIP (Temporal Key
Integrity Protocol, pronounced “tee-kip”) for encryption. TKIP generates a different key for every transmission; however, the encryption algorithm used for its calculations is no longer considered secure.
●● WPA2. WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) typically uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption, which provides faster and more secure encryption than TKIP. All wireless devices sold today support
the WPA2 standard.
●● WPA3. WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) offers better encryption and additional features over WPA2. For
example, you can securely configure a nearby wireless device, such as a wireless webcam or motion sensor,
over the wireless network, eliminating the need to connect the device with a wired connection to configure
it. Another feature is Individual Data Encryption, which allows a secure connection for your laptop or other
wireless device over a public, unsecured Wi-Fi network.
To configure Wi-Fi encryption for our sample router, first know that each band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) is assigned
its own encryption type. For the most flexibility, set both bands to the highest encryption standards the router and
wireless devices support. By selecting WPA2/WPA3-Personal (see Figure 19-43), a wireless connection will use WPA3
unless an older device does not support it, in which case the connection reverts to WPA2 encryption. Click Apply
to save your changes.

Authentication Services in an Enterprise
If you are called on to configure a SOHO router in an enterprise environment, you might need to configure the security
protocol with an Enterprise standard, for example, WPA3-Enterprise. In this situation, authentication to the wireless
network is done using an authentication server in cooperation with Active Directory on a Windows domain. Three wellknown security protocols to provide authentication services for large networks are RADIUS, TACACS+, and Kerberos:
●● RADIUS (Remote Access Dial-In User Service) protocol was originally designed just for authentication, but it
has evolved to include authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. It works with dial-up,
wired and wireless networking, and VPNs. RADIUS uses the UDP protocol and port 1812 for authentication
and authorization and port 1813 for accounting.
●● TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus) is a proprietary Cisco protocol for AAA
services, specifically designed for network administrators and technicians to remotely connect to a network
to configure and manage Cisco network devices, such as routers, switches, and firewalls. TACACS+ uses
TCP protocol and port 49.
●● Kerberos is strictly an authentication protocol and is used when a Windows computer authenticates a user
to Active Directory in a Windows domain. It uses AES encryption, UDP protocol, and port 88. Kerberos
supports two-factor authentication, whereas RADIUS and TACACS+ do not.
Figure 19-43 Select the highest encryption
standards the network supports
Looking back at Figure 19-40, you can see that WPA2/WPA3-Personal is selected as the authentication method.
A Personal method relies on a passphrase shared with all network users, which could be compromised. An Enterprise
method relies on an authentication server to manage authenticating all users to the network. Very few SOHO networks,
however, have the resources to set up and host an authentication server. In most cases, when setting up a SOHO
network, your most secure option is Personal.
Note 6
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam may give you a scenario that requires you to install and configure a wireless network—including
Wi-Fi 802.11standards, frequencies, channels (1–11)—and encryption protocols including WPA2, WPA3, TKIP encryption, and AES encryption.

RADIUS, TACACS+, and Kerberos can each authenticate a user to resources on a network using an authentication
server, and that server will most likely turn to Active Directory to authenticate user credentials. The key differences
among the three protocols are when and where they are used:
●● RADIUS and TACACS+ extend authentication out to non-Windows devices—such as a switch, router, or
WAP—to connect a device to the network.
●● For a wireless network, RADIUS or TACACS+ is used to authenticate via an authentication server rather than
using a network security key.
●● TACACS+ is used on Cisco switches, routers, and other networking devices. RADIUS is used on non-Cisco
devices, such as an ASUS wireless router.
●● Kerberos is used on Windows computers already connected to the network to authenticate to a Windows domain.
Notice in Figure 19-44 that either the WAP using RADIUS or the switch using TACACS+ acts as the client, which
is responsible for querying the authentication server before allowing the device on the network. The authentication
server interfaces with Active Directory as part of the authentication process. (Cisco calls its TACACS+ server the
Identify Service Engine server or ISE server.)

Using Remote Access Technologies
Core 2 Objective 4.9
An IT technician often finds it necessary to remotely access systems they support and use. You might need to
remotely transfer files, access your Windows desktop or a corporate server, access monitoring and management
software that you are using to oversee critical systems, assist users by accessing their systems with screen sharing,
or support corporate video conferencing.
Several methods and tools to help with these tasks have already been covered in previous modules. In this section of this module, we summarize tools already covered, look at some new ones, and consider security issues when
using these tools. Let’s begin with file transfers.
File Transfers over the Internet
Core 2 Objective 4.9
In previous modules, you learned about FTP, the tried-and-true tool to transfer files over a network or the Internet.
FTP software is free and easy to install, but it has some limitations. Services on the web that have slowly replaced
FTP as the file transfer tool of choice include OneDrive (onedrive.live.com), Dropbox (dropbox.com), Box (box.com),
Google Drive (drive.google.com), and other web-based solutions. Figure 19-46 shows OneDrive and Dropbox embedded in Explorer in Windows 10.
Often, a basic WAP isn’t smart enough to act as the RADIUS or TACACS+ client. In an enterprise environment, many
WAPs are connected to a wireless controller device in the data closet, which in turn does the work of managing client
requests to the RADIUS or ISE server.
Note 7
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to be able to compare and contrast RADIUS, TACACS+, and Kerberos, including identifying which authentication protocol supports multifactor authentication.

Comparing Dropbox to FTP, Dropbox is faster, more secure, and easier to use. FTP uses the FTP protocol and
incoming and outgoing ports 20 and 21. With FTP, several commands pass back and forth before a file can be transferred, causing a slower transfer process. Dropbox uses a single HTTPS connection for both uploads and downloads,
and it can compress files before transferring. In addition, Dropbox is able to upload only the parts of a file (call
the diff or difference) that have changed since the last upload, and it can upload a file in segments to multiple IP
addresses, further speeding up the process.
Windows 10/11 Remote Control Tools
Core 2 Objective 4.9
Windows 10/11 offers two solutions to remotely access a computer: Remote Desktop Connection and Microsoft
Remote Assistance. Both tools use the RDP protocol and port 3389 and require a little setup to use. Let’s see how
each works.
Remote Desktop Connection (RDC)
Remote Desktop Connection (RDC), commonly called Remote Desktop, gives a user access to a Windows desktop
from anywhere on the Internet. As a software developer, I find Remote Desktop extremely useful when I work from
a remote location (my home office) and need to access a corporate network to support software on that network.
Using the Internet, I can access a file server on these secured networks to make my software changes. Remote Desktop is easy to use and relatively safe for the corporate network. To use Remote Desktop, the computer you want to
remotely access (the server) must be running business or professional editions of Windows 10/11, but the computer
you’re using to access it (the client) can be running any version of Windows.
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to know how to use Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance and to know which port
and protocol they use and which tool is appropriate in a given scenario.

Configuring Remote Desktop on Two Computers
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 4.9
The host or server computer is the computer that serves up Remote Desktop to client computers that can “remote
in to” (remotely access) the server. To prepare your host computer, you need to configure it for static IP addressing
and then configure the Remote Desktop service. Here are the steps needed:
1. Configure the computer for static IP addressing.
Applying Concepts
Figure 19-47 Configure a computer to run the
Remote Desktop service
How to assign a static IP address is covered in the
Core 1 module “Networking Fundamentals.”
Core to Core
2. If your computer is behind a firewall, configure
the router for port forwarding and allow
incoming traffic on port 3389. Forward that
traffic to the IP address of your desktop
computer.
3. To turn on the Remote Desktop service,
right-click Start and click System. In the
About window, click Remote desktop. In the
Remote Desktop window (see Figure 19-47),
enable Remote Desktop. You can also control
other Remote Desktop settings from this
window.
Server applications such as Remote Desktop listen for network activity from clients. If you want these server
applications to be available at all times, you can set your network adapter properties to Wake-on-LAN, which
you learned about in the Core 1 module “Networking Fundamentals.”

4. To verify that Windows Defender Firewall is set to allow Remote Desktop activity on this computer, open
Control Panel in classic view, and click Windows Defender Firewall. In the Windows Defender Firewall
window, click Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall.
5. The Allowed apps window appears. Scroll down to Remote Desktop, and adjust the settings as needed
(see Figure 19-48). Click OK to apply any changes. You are now ready to test Remote Desktop.

Is your host computer as safe as it was before you set it to serve up Remote Desktop and enabled port forwarding to it? Actually, no, because a port has been opened, so take this into account when you decide to use Remote
Desktop.
Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA)
Core 2 Objective 4.9
Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA) differs from Remote Desktop in that a user on the server computer can
remain signed in during the remote session, retains control of the session, and can see the screen. This is helpful
when troubleshooting problems on a computer. The user who needs your help sends you an invitation by email or
chat to connect to their computer using Remote Assistance. When you respond to the invitation, you can see the
user’s desktop just as they see it; if the user gives you permission, you can take control of their computer to change
settings or do whatever else is needed to fix their problem or show them how to perform a task. Think of Remote
Assistance as a way to provide virtual desk-side support.
There are several ways to initiate a Remote Assistance session. The first method listed is the most reliable:
●● The user saves an invitation file and then sends that file to the technician. The file can be sent by any
method, including email, chat, or posting to a shared folder on the network.
●● The user can send an automated email through the Remote Assistance app. This option only works if the
system is configured with a compatible email program.
●● The user can use Easy Connect, which is the easiest method to start a Remote Assistance connection, but it
only works if both computers used for the connection are using Windows. Also know that some routers don’t
support the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP), which is the protocol Easy Connect uses to establish
a Remote Assistance connection.
●● The technician can initiate a session. This method is the most difficult to use; it requires that Group Policies
be applied on the technician’s computer.
When a remote desktop connection is made, the user sitting at the remote computer will see it return to the
Windows sign-on screen.
Note 10
6. When you click in the remote desktop’s window, you can work with the remote computer just as if
you were sitting in front of it, except response time is slower. To move files back and forth between
computers, use Explorer on the remote computer. Files on your local computer and on the remote
computer will appear in the Explorer window on the remote computer. For example, you can see drive
C: on each computer labeled in Figure 19-53. To close the connection to the remote computer, sign out
from the remote computer or close the desktop window.
Even though Windows normally allows more than one user to be signed in at the same time, this is not the case
with Remote Desktop. When a Remote Desktop session is open, all local users on the remote computer must
sign out after receiving a warning.

To initiate a Remote Assistance connection when the
user sends an invitation to the technician, follow these
steps:
1. To allow Remote Assistance sessions on the
user’s computer, called the host computer,
right-click Start, and click System. In the About
window, click System protection. In the System
Properties dialog box, click the Remote tab. See
Figure 19-55.
2. In the Remote Assistance area, check Allow
Remote Assistance connections to this
computer, and then click OK.
3. In the search box, type remote assistance, and
then click Invite someone to connect to your
PC and help you, or offer to help someone
else. The Windows Remote Assistance box
appears, as shown in Figure 19-56.
Figure 19-54 Use the Services console to start a service
Easy Connect is the easiest method for the user when initiating a Remote Assistance connection, but it can be the most
difficult for the technician to set up. If Easy Connect is grayed out when starting a session, chances are that the PNRP
service might be down. To start the service, enter the services.msc command to open the Services console (see
Figure 19-54). Select Peer Name Resolution Protocol, and click Start.

With Remote Desktop, you can share files between computers, but Remote Assistance does not allow for file
sharing. Here are some things you can do during a Remote Assistance session:
●● To open a chat session with the user, click the Chat icon. A chat pane appears in the Remote Assistance
window on both desktops.
●● To ask the user if you can take control of their desktop, click Request control in the Remote Assistance
control window. When the user accepts the request, you can control their computer. The user can stop
sharing control by clicking Stop sharing.
●● The user can hide their desktop from you at any time by clicking Pause in the control window.
●● Either of you can disconnect the session by closing the control window.
●● A log file is kept of every Remote Assistance session in the C:\Users\username\Documents\Remote
Assistance Logs folder. The file includes the chat session. If you type instructions during the chat session
that will be helpful for the user later, they can use the log file to remind them of what was said and done.
●● If an invitation created by a user is not used within six hours, the invitation expires. This time frame can be
changed by clicking Advanced in the Remote Assistance section on the Remote tab of the System Properties
dialog box.
The technician can respond to the invitation into Remote Assistance as follows:
1. On the technician’s computer, the technician double-clicks the invitation file they received from the user.
In the box that appears, the technician enters the password that appeared on the user’s screen, and
clicks OK. (Most often, the user reads the password to the technician over the phone.)
2. The user’s computer generates a warning box requesting permission for the technician’s computer
to connect (see the right side of Figure 19-57). The user clicks Yes to allow the connection. The user’s
desktop turns black, and the Remote Assistance management window appears. The technician’s
computer opens the Windows Remote Assistance window, as shown in Figure 19-58, with a live feed from
the user’s computer.

Virtual Network Computing (VNC)
Core 2 Objective 4.9
Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is client/server software used to remotely control a computer, file transfers, and
screen sharing. VNC Connect (realvnc.com) by RealVNC is one example of this type of software. See Figure 19-59.
It can be used for virtual desktop support and unattended access to a remote computer. When used for virtual
If you have problems making the connection, consider the following:
1. Windows Defender Firewall on the user’s computer might be blocking Remote Assistance. Verify that
Remote Assistance is checked as an exception to blocked apps in the Windows Defender Firewall
window.
2. If you are outside the user’s local network, the hardware firewall protecting their network might be
blocking Remote Assistance. Verify that port forwarding on that hardware firewall is enabled for Remote
Assistance. Remote Assistance uses port 3389, the same RDP port used by Remote Desktop.
Because Remote Assistance can be difficult to set up, Windows 10/11 offers Quick Assist, which is more universally
compatible with existing network hardware configurations. For Quick Assist to work, both computers must be running
Windows 10 or Windows 11, the technician providing assistance must have a Microsoft account, and the person receiving the connection must agree to it by entering a code generated by the technician’s client computer.

where images of the desktop and keystrokes are passed between client and server. The server side of VNC—the computer being controlled—can be installed in Windows, Linux, and macOS. The client side of VNC, called the viewer,
controls the other computer and can be installed in Windows, UNIX, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS.
Weaknesses of VNC include the large volume of screen data transferred during a session and poor encryption
that can be hacked. To secure a VNC session, you can use a VPN connection, which encrypts the session end to end.
Alternately, for Linux systems, you can use an SSH tunnel to encrypt the connection. In a project at the end of this
module, you practice using a VNC session to remotely control a Windows computer.
Secure Shell (SSH)
Core 2 Objective 4.9
Secure Shell, also called the SSH protocol, is open-source software to remotely sign in to and control another
computer. It was designed to replace Telnet and FTP on Linux systems. Recall from the Core 1 module “Networking
Fundamentals” that Telnet can remotely control another computer, and FTP is used for file transfers; neither of these
programs encrypts transmissions. Secure Shell encrypts the entire session, including the authentication of credentials used to sign in. The server end of Secure Shell is preinstalled in most UNIX and Linux systems. A well-known
client program for Secure Shell is PuTTY (putty.org), a file transfer program available in Linux and Windows. You
can establish a secure session between a client computer and Linux server using Secure Shell and then run another
program, such as a VNC program, over the Secure Shell connection using tunneling.
Secure Shell uses port 22 and creates an encrypted session using a method called public key encryption with
two SSH keys. See Figure 19-60. The SSH client starts the process by contacting the server and requesting its public
SSH key. The server sends the public key and starts negotiating the parameters of the secure channel. The client
uses the public key to authenticate the server and uses its own private key to encrypt the user’s credentials, which
are sent to the server for the server to authenticate the user to the server OS. In a project at the end of this module,
you learn to use SSH and PuTTY.
Figure 19-60 Public key encryption is used to secure an SSH session
1. Client starts the process by contacting server.
2. Server sends public key. (This is who I am.)
3. Server and client negotiate and open the secure session.
4. Client sends user credentials for OS login to server.
Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM)
Core 2 Objective 4.9
Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software, such as RMM by Atera (atera.com), is installed on systems
to monitor and manage these systems remotely so IT personnel can more easily support these systems. RMM
software can be used in-house to help the internal IT department better do its job, or it can be used by a managed
services provider (MSP), which is an IT organization that a company contracts with to support its IT needs. RMM
software features include the ability to monitor systems in real time, send alerts to management and IT personnel
when potential problems arise, automatically run scripts (for example, backup scripts and scripts to install security
patches), and analyze and report system performance and reliability.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Now let’s see how to use each utility.
ping [–a] [–t] [targetname]
Core 2 Objective 1.2
The ping command tests connectivity by sending an echo request to a remote computer. If the remote computer is
online, detects the signal, and is configured to respond to a ping, it responds. (Responding to a ping is the default
Windows setting, although some companies disable responding to ping, especially on computers that can be reached
from the Internet.) Use ping to test for connectivity or to verify that DNS is working. Ping cannot verify other network
services on the computer are working. If a ping does not work, after reasonable investigation into the source of the
problem, check with a security administrator to determine if the network might be under attack.
Security Benefits of Third-Party Tools
Core 2 Objective 4.9
You’ve just learned about several screen-sharing, video-conferencing, file transfer, desktop management, and RMM
software suites. When evaluating the security risks of one of these types of programs, consider whether the program
requires you to open a port to your network. For example, Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance both require you
to open port 3389, which is a security risk. Third-party remote access software executed from a browser window
is more secure because the browser initiates communication outside the protected network, and opening listening
ports is not required. Examples of this type of software, some of which are free, are TeamViewer (teamviewer.com),
GoToMyPC by Citrix (gotomypc.com), LogMeIn (logmein.com), and Zoom (zoom.us). When evaluating third-party
remote access applications, consider the following:
●● Where is software installed—on the host, on the client, or on both computers?
●● How secure is the connection? Are you required to open incoming ports?
●● How are live screens shared? For example, is a live screen shared only by the host computer, or can it be
shifted to another computer in the same screen-sharing session?
●● Can files be shared in one or both directions during the same screen-sharing session?
Troubleshooting Network Connections
Core 2 Objective 1.2
Windows 10/11 includes several utilities you can use to troubleshoot networking problems. In this section of the
module, you learn to use ping, hostname, ipconfig, nslookup, tracert, pathping, two net commands, and netstat.
Most of these program files are found in the \Windows\System32 folder.
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you, when given a scenario, to know when and how to use these network utilities: ping,
hostname ipconfig, nslookup, ifconfig, tracert, pathping, net use, net user, and netstat. You should know when and how
to use each utility and how to interpret results. In addition, these commands form the foundation you’ll need when
studying more advanced networking.
If a ping to a host using its IP address works, but a ping to the same host using its domain name does not work, DNS is
down. Try different DNS servers, such as 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, the Google public DNS servers.

A few examples of ping are discussed in Table 19-2. Two examples are shown in Figure 19-61.
Ping Command Description
ping 69.32.208.75 Ping tests for connectivity using an IP address. If the remote computer responds, the
round-trip times are displayed.
ping –a 69.32.208.75 The –a parameter tests for name resolution. Use it to display the host name and verify
that DNS is working.
ping –t 69.32.208.75 The –t parameter causes pinging to continue until interrupted. To display statistics, press
Ctrl+Break. To stop pinging, press Ctrl+C.
ping 127.0.0.1 This is called a loopback address test. The IP address 127.0.0.1 always refers to the local
computer. If the local computer does not respond, you can assume there is a problem
with the network connection’s configuration.
ping cengage.com Use a host name to find out the IP address of a remote computer. If the computer does
not respond, suspect there is a problem with DNS. On the other hand, some computers
are not configured to respond to pings.
Table 19-2 Examples of the ping command
Figure 19-61 Use ping to test for connectivity and name
resolution
hostname
Core 2 Objective 1.2
The hostname command displays the hostname of the computer. The command has no parameters.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
nslookup
[computername]
Core 2 Objective 1.2
The nslookup (namespace lookup or name
server lookup) command is used to test
name-resolution problems with DNS servers
by allowing you to request information from
a DNS server’s zone data, which is the portion of the DNS namespace that the server
knows about. For example, to find out what
your DNS server knows about the domain
name microsoft.com, enter this command:
nslookup microsoft.com
ipconfig [/all] [/release] [/renew] [/displaydns] [/flushdns]
Core 2 Objective 1.2
The ipconfig (IP configuration) command can display network configuration information and refresh the TCP/IP
assignments for a connection, including its IP address. Some examples of the command are listed in Table 19-3.
Ipconfig Command Description
ipconfig /all Displays a network connection’s configuration information, including the MAC address.
ipconfig /release Releases the IP address and other TCP/IP assignments when dynamic IP addressing is
being used.
ipconfig /release6 Releases an IPv6 address and other TCP/IP assignments.
ipconfig /renew Leases a new IP address from a DHCP server. Make sure you release the IP address
before you renew it.
ipconfig /renew6 Leases a new IPv6 address from a DHCP IPv6 server. Make sure you release the IPv6
address before you renew it.
ipconfig /displaydns Displays information about name resolutions that Windows currently holds in the DNS
resolver cache.
ipconfig /flushdns Flushes the name resolver cache, which might solve a problem when the browser cannot
find a host on the Internet.
Table 19-3 Examples of the ipconfig command
Only the more commonly used parameters or switches for each command are discussed in this module. For several
of these commands, you can use the /? or /help parameter to get more information. For even more information about
each command, search the docs.microsoft.com site.
Note 15
Figure 19-62 The nslookup command reports information
about the Internet namespace
Figure 19-62 shows the results. Notice in the figure that the DNS server reports five different IPv4 addresses
assigned to microsoft.com. It also reports that this information is nonauthoritative, meaning that it is not the authoritative, or final, name server for the microsoft.com domain name.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
tracert [targetname]
Core 2 Objective 1.2
The tracert (trace route) command can be useful when you’re trying to resolve a problem reaching a destination
host such as an FTP site or website. The command sends a series of requests to the destination computer and displays each hop to the destination. (A hop happens when a message moves from one router to another.) For example,
to trace the route to the cengage.com web server, enter this command in a command prompt window:
tracert cengage.com
The results of this command for one location are shown in Figure 19-63; your results will be different. A message
is assigned a Time to Live (TTL), which is the number of hops it can make before a router drops the message and
sends an error message back to the host that sent the original message (see Figure 19-64). The tracert command
creates its report from these messages. If a router doesn’t respond, the Request timed out message appears.
A reverse lookup is when you run the nslookup command to find the host name when you know a computer’s
IP address, such as:
nslookup 69.32.208.75
To find out the default DNS server for a network, use the nslookup command with no parameters.
Figure 19-63 The tracert command traces a path to a destination computer
The Linux dig command gives information similar to the Windows nslookup command. You learn to use dig in the
module “Linux and Scripting.”

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
pathping
Core 2 Objective 1.2
The pathping command combines the ping and tracert commands into a single command to help identify where on
the network path the network might be slow or giving problems. For example, to show problems along the way to
the cengage.com site, enter this command:
pathping cengage.com
The net Commands
Core 2 Objective 1.2
The net command is several commands in one, and most of the net commands require an elevated command prompt
window, which allows commands that require administrator privileges in Windows. In this section, you learn about
the net use and net user commands. The net use command connects or disconnects a computer from a shared
resource, or it can display information about connections.
Enter the following commands to pass a user name and password to the \\bluelight remote computer, and then
map a network drive to the \Medical folder on that computer:
net use \\bluelight\Medical /user:”Jean Andrews” mypassword
net use z: \\bluelight\Medical
The double quotation marks are needed in the first command because the user name has a space in it.
A persistent network connection is one that happens at each logon. To make the two commands persistent, add
the /persistent parameter like this:
net use \\bluelight\Medical /user:”Jean Andrews” mypassword /persistent:yes
net use z: \\bluelight\Medical /persistent:yes
To disconnect a network drive, enter this command:
net use z: /delete
The net user command manages user accounts. For example, the built-in administrator account is disabled by
default. To activate the account, enter this net user command:
net user administrator /active:yes

netstat Command Description
netstat Lists statistics about the network connection, including the IP addresses of active
connections.
netstat >>netlog.txt Directs output to a text file.
netstat –b Lists programs that are using the connection (see Figure 19-66) and is useful for finding
malware that might be using the network. The –b switch requires an elevated command
prompt.
netstat –b –o Includes the process ID of each program listed. When you know the process ID, you can
use the taskkill command to end the process.
netstat –a Lists statistics about all active connections and the ports the computer is listening on.
netstat –na List all open ports.
Table 19-4 netstat commands
netstat [–a] [–b] [–o]

Module Summary
Securing Workstations and IoT Devices on a Network
●● Most browsers allow you to sign in and sync data across devices and to the cloud; manage extensions,
plug-ins, and passwords to websites; block pop-ups and ads; clear the browsing cache; and control privacy
settings.
●● Browsers use digital certificates to validate the identity of websites.
●● Internet Options in Control Panel can be used to manage proxy server settings for the Windows system and
all installed browsers.
●● To download a new browser securely, verify the download and installation routine is digitally signed and
compare hashes for the downloaded file.
●● Use a VPN connection to encrypt communication with a remote network across the Internet.
●● A computer can use a USB or embedded broadband device with a SIM card to make a WWAN connection to
the Internet via a cellular carrier.
●● Windows can monitor a metered connection to send an alert when data usage has reached a threshold.
●● Windows Defender Firewall in Windows 10/11 provides personal firewall services on a laptop or workstation
to protect the computer from attack over the Internet.
●● Z-Wave and Zigbee are wireless communication protocols used by IoT devices on a network. Both protocols
use encryption. Neither supports TCP/IP without an additional protocol layer such as Z/IP or Zigbee IP.
Zigbee is more robust than Z-Wave and is generally the choice for large-scale industrial use.

Securing a Multifunction Router for a SOHO Network
●● A multifunction router for a small office/home office (SOHO) network might serve several functions, including
router, switch, DHCP server, wireless access point (WAP), firewall, and file server.
●● Place a router in a secure location, and it if is being used as a WAP, make sure it is centrally located for users.
●● It’s extremely important to change the administrative password on a router as soon as you install it, especially if the router also serves as a wireless access point.
●● To configure a router to secure and serve the local network, you can update firmware, assign a static
WAN IP address, reserve IP addresses for the DHCP server, configure UPnP, and configure QoS for priority
applications.
●● To allow certain network traffic initiated from the Internet past your firewall, you can use port forwarding,
a DMZ, screened subnets, and content filtering with whitelists or blacklists.
●● Access to the network can be controlled by allowing or denying certain applications and ports and by IP
filtering.
●● To secure a wireless access point, you can require a security key, change the default SSID, select specific
Wi-Fi channels, disable guest access, and enable encryption (WPA, WPA2, or WPA3).
●● An enterprise might use RADIUS, TACACS+, and/or Kerberos software to help with authentication to the
network and/or enterprise resources. On a wireless network, RADIUS or TACACS+ is used rather than a network security key to authenticate to the wireless network. TACACS+ is used specifically with Cisco devices.
Kerberos is used within a network for a Windows client to authenticate to a Windows domain.
Using Remote Access Technologies
●● File transfer technologies include FTP and HTTP-based technologies such as Dropbox and Google Drive.
●● Windows 10/11 offers Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) and Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA) to
remotely manage a Windows 10/11 desktop. Remote Desktop gives you access to your Windows desktop
and file sharing from anywhere on the Internet. Remote Assistance lets you provide remote support to users
but does not allow file sharing.
●● Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is used for remote desktop management, screen sharing, and file transfers. Software must be installed on both the client and the server.
●● Secure Shell (SSH) is open-source software that is preinstalled in most Linux and UNIX systems and provides
an encrypted connection for a client computer to remotely control a Linux or UNIX host.
●● Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software remotely monitors and manages systems to support
IT personnel responsible for these systems either in-house or in a managed services provider (MSP) role.
●● When evaluating third-party remote access applications, consider the security of the connection and how
screens and files are shared.
Troubleshooting Network Connections
●● Useful Windows command-line utilities for network troubleshooting are ping, hostname, ipconfig, nslookup,
tracert, pathping, net use, net user, and netstat.

Thinking Critically
These questions are designed to prepare you for the critical thinking required for the A+ exams and may use
information from other modules and the web.
1. As an IT technician, you arrive at a customer’s home office to troubleshoot problems they are experiencing
with their printer. While questioning the customer to get an understanding of their network, you find
they have a new Wi-Fi router that connects wirelessly to a new desktop and two new laptops, in addition
to multiple smartphones, tablets, and the network printer. They also have several smart home devices,
including security cameras, light switches, door locks, and a thermostat supported by an IoT controller
hub. To work on the printer, which type of network will you be interacting with?
a. PAN
b. WAN
c. WMN
d. LAN
2. While you work on the customer’s printer, they continue chatting about their network and the problems
they’ve been experiencing. One complaint is that the Internet service slows down considerably in the
evening. You suspect you know the cause of this problem: Their neighbors arrive home in the evening and
bog down the ISP’s local infrastructure. To be sure, you take a quick look at the back of their modem. What
type of cable connected to the WAN port would confirm your suspicions and why?
3. Your customer then asks you if it would be worth the investment for them to have Ethernet cabling installed
to reach each of their workstations instead of connecting them by Wi-Fi to the network. Specifically, they
want to know if that would speed up communications for the workstations. You examine their router and
find that it’s using 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Would you advise them to upgrade to Ethernet? Why or why not?
a. Yes, because Ethernet is faster than 802.11ac.
b. Yes, because wired connections are always faster than wireless connections.
c. No, because installing Ethernet cabling is more expensive than the increased speed is worth.
d. No, because 802.11ac speeds are faster than Ethernet.
4. You run the ipconfig command on your computer, and it reports an IP address of 169.254.75.10 on the
Ethernet interface. Which device assigned this IP address to the interface?
a. The ISP’s DNS server
b. The local network’s DHCP server on the SOHO router
c. The cable modem
d. The local computer

5. You’ve just received a call from human resources asking for assistance with a problem. One of your
company’s employees, Ahmed, has recently undergone extensive surgery and will be homebound for three
to five months. He plans on working from home and needs a solution to enable frequent and extended
access to the company network’s resources. Which WAN technology will you need to configure for Ahmed,
and which tool will you use to configure it?
a. WWAN using the Network Connections window
b. Wi-Fi using the Network and Sharing Center
c. Ethernet using the Network Connections window
d. VPN using the Network and Sharing Center
6. Your manager has asked you to configure a DHCP reservation on the network for a Windows computer that
is used to configure other devices on a network. To do this, you need the computer’s MAC address. What
command can you enter at the command line to access this information?
7. You’re setting up a Minecraft gaming server so you and several of your friends can share a realm during
your gameplay. To do this, your friends will need to access your server over the Internet, which means you
must configure your router to send this traffic to your game server. Which router feature will you use, and
which port must you open for TCP traffic?
8. While troubleshooting an Internet connection problem for your network, you restarted the modem and
then the router. The router is now communicating with the Internet, which you can confirm by observing
the blinking light on the router’s WAN indicator. However, now your laptop is not communicating with the
router. Order the following commands to confirm there is no connectivity, apply a fix to the problem, and
confirm connectivity.
a. ping
b. ipconfig /renew
c. nslookup microsoft.com
d. ipconfig /release
9. You need a VPN to connect to a private, remote network in order to access some files. You click the
network icon in your taskbar to establish the connection, and you realize there is no VPN option available
on the menu. What tool do you need to use to fix this problem?
a. net command
b. netstat command
c. Network and Sharing Center
d. Network Connections window
10. To prepare to remotely work on a Linux server at work while you are at home, you install VNC Server for
Linux by RealVNC (realvnc.com) on the system at work. When you get home, you install the VNC Viewer
for Windows on your Windows 10 laptop. When you try to make the connection, you get an error about a
refused connection. Which could be a cause of the error? (Choose all that apply.)
a. VNC Viewer for Windows will not work with a Linux server. Use Remote Desktop instead.
b. Port 5901 is not set for port forwarding on the corporate router. Configure the router next time you’re in
the office.
c. VNC Server for Linux must be configured to tunnel through SSH. Set up the SSH tunnel next time you’re
in the office.
d. A VNC solution will not work with Linux. Configure Remote Desktop on the Linux server, and use it with
the Remote Desktop client on your home computer.

18. Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance require a technician to change port settings and firewall settings,
but third-party apps such as GoToMyPC do not. Why is this?
a. Microsoft makes its apps more secure than third-party apps.
b. GoToMyPC and other third-party apps use ports already left open for web browsing and don’t require
additional incoming connections.
c. Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance allow incoming connections at the same port 80 that is already
left open for web browsing.
d. GoToMyPC and other third-party apps are not concerned about security because they depend on
Windows to secure a network connection.
19. Manuel works on a help desk and is assigned a ticket that was automatically generated by a server because
of an error. The error message states that the server has run out of storage space because logs were not
set to delete at a certain size. Rather than going to the data center to physically access that server on the
rack, what Windows tool might Manuel use to troubleshoot the server?
20. While investigating the settings on your SOHO router, you find two IP addresses reported on the device’s
routing table, which is used to determine where to send incoming data. The two IP addresses are
192.168.2.1 and 71.9.200.235. Which of these IP addresses would you expect to see listed as the default
gateway on the devices in your local network? How do you know?
21. The documentation for your router says that it can provide content filtering to filter out keywords except
for pages that use the HTTPS protocol. Why is that?
a. Privacy laws make it illegal to filter content in HTTPS pages.
b. HTTPS pages are encrypted, and the router cannot decrypt them to read the content.
c. The router must use its public key to transmit HTTPS pages.
d. The software to filter content in HTTPS pages is not installed on this particular router.
22. Your manager asks you to transmit a small file that includes sensitive personnel data to a Linux server
on the network. The server is running a Telnet server and an SSH server. Why is it not a good idea to use
Telnet to reach the remote computer?
a. Telnet transmissions are not encrypted.
b. Telnet is not reliable, and the file might arrive corrupted.
c. SSH is faster than Telnet.
d. SSH running on the same computer as Telnet causes Telnet not to work.
23. While troubleshooting an IPv4 network connection problem, you start to wonder if the local computer’s
NIC is configured correctly for TCP/IP settings. What command should you enter at the command prompt
to test your theory?
24. Your SOHO router has failed, and you have installed a new router. The old router’s static IP address on the
network is 192.168.0.1. The new router has a static IP address of 10.0.0.1. You go to a computer to configure
the new router, and you enter 10.0.0.1 in the browser address box. The router does not respond. You open
a command prompt window and try to ping the router, which does not work. Next, you verify that the
router has connectivity, and you see that its local connection light is blinking, indicating connectivity. What
is the most likely problem and its best solution?
a. The computer you are using to configure the router has a corrupted TCP/IP configuration. Restart the
computer.
b. The router is defective. Return it for a full refund.
c. The computer and the router are not in the same subnet. Release and renew the IP address of the
computer.
d. The computer and the router are not in the same subnet. Change the subnet mask assigned to
the computer.

Implementing More Security for Remote Desktop
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 4.9
When Hakim travels on company business, he finds it’s a great help to be able to access his office computer from
anywhere on the road using Remote Desktop. However, he wants to make sure his office computer and the corporate network are as safe as possible. One way you can help Hakim add more security is to change the listening port
that Remote Desktop uses. Knowledgeable hackers know that Remote Desktop uses port 3389, but if you change
this port to a secret port, hackers are less likely to find the open port. Search the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles
(support.microsoft.com and docs.microsoft.com) for a way to change the listening port that Remote Desktop uses.
Practice implementing this change by doing the following:
1. Set up Remote Desktop on a computer using a business or professional edition of Windows. This computer
is your host computer. Use another computer (the client computer) to create a Remote Desktop session to
the host computer. Verify that the session works by transferring files in both directions.
2. Next, change the port that Remote Desktop uses on the host computer to a secret port. Save or print
a screenshot showing how you made the change. Use the client computer to create a Remote Desktop
session to the host computer using the secret port. Print a screenshot showing how you made the
connection using the secret port. Verify that the session works by transferring files in both directions.
3. What secret port did you use? What link on the Microsoft websites gave you the information you needed?
Real Problem 19-2
Using SSH and PuTTY
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 4.9
Follow these steps to install Linux in a VM, and use the PuTTY program for remote access to the Linux host via an
SSH connection:
1. To download Ubuntu Server, go to releases.ubuntu.com, and download the latest release of Ubuntu
Server install image, which is an ISO file.
2. In Windows 10/11 Pro, open Hyper-V Manager, and use it to create a new VM. Use the downloaded ISO file
to install Ubuntu Server in the VM. What is the server name, your user name, and your password? Accept all
default settings. When you get to the screen that gives you the option to install the OpenSSH server, choose
to install the server. Notice that Ubuntu allows you to import your SSH keys from GitHub or Launchpad. It is
not necessary to import SSH keys at this time.
3. Remove the ISO file from the VM’s virtual DVD drive, and reboot the server.
4. Sign in to Ubuntu Server, and enter this command to install some networking tools, including the ifconfig
command:
sudo apt install net-tools
5. Enter the ifconfig command to find out the IP address of the server. What is its IP address?

6. Go to putty.org and download and install the PuTTY program on your Windows 10/11 computer.
Launch PuTTY.
7. Enter the IP address of your server in the PuTTY window, and make sure PuTTY is set to use SSH. What port
does SSH use? Connect your Windows 10/11 computer to the Ubuntu Server in an SSH session. When asked
if you trust the host key the server presented, click Accept.
8. Remotely log in to the server with your Ubuntu Server user name and password. Try the hostname
command in the PuTTY window. Did the command return the name of the Ubuntu Server?
9. Use this command in the PuTTY window to shut down the server:
sudo shutdown now
10. You can now close all windows.
Be sure to save your Ubuntu Server VM because you’ll need it again for the module “Linux and Scripting,” where
you learn much more about Ubuntu Server.

Introduction
In this module, you learn about another operating system for desktops and laptops other than Windows: macOS.
As you will see, understanding Windows gives you a solid foundation to approach learning and supporting other
operating systems, including macOS. IT technicians are expected to be familiar with a variety of operating systems
and operating environments. This module and the module “Linux and Scripting” equip you with the skills you will
need to work in those environments.
Getting to Know the macOS Desktop
Core 2 Objective 1.10
macOS, previously called Mac OS X, is a proprietary operating system that is only available for Macintosh computers by Apple Inc. (apple.com). Like Linux, macOS is built on a UNIX foundation and has been evolving and improving
since its original release in 1984. (UNIX is a popular OS used to control networks and to support server applications
available on the Internet.) At the time of this writing, macOS Monterey was just released, and some users are converting to it from the last release, macOS Big Sur.
The Mac keyboard has some special keys. See Figure 20-1. However, don’t depend on these special keys because
a customer might have a regular keyboard connected via a USB port. The touch pad on a Mac laptop is called the
trackpad, and it is a touch pad on steroids; you can use multiple fingers and actions called gestures, which you learn
about as you read through this section of the module. Some newer MacBooks have Touch ID as a biometric scanner
for fingerprints included on the keyboard as seen in Figure 20-1.

Now let’s get to know the macOS interface, including the desktop with its dock and Apple menu, Finder,
Launchpad, System Preferences, Spotlight, Mission Control, multiple desktops, iCloud Drive, Keychain, Screen
Sharing, Remote Disc, and Terminal.
The macOS desktop, with its major components labeled, is shown in Figure 20-2. The Finder application, which
can help you find applications and data files, is open and active. Because Finder is the currently active application,
the menu bar for the Finder window is displayed at the top of the screen. The Finder menu bar provides drop-down
menus that contain options for working with applications, files, and the interface.
By default, the dock appears at the bottom of the desktop. It contains shortcut icons to access frequently used
applications. To open an application from its icon in the dock, click it once. The icons in the dock that represent
open applications have a small black or white dot underneath them. The macOS desktop can also include shortcuts
that provide quick access to files, folders, and applications.
When a window is open, three circles in the upper-left corner (see Figure 20-3A) provide options for manipulating the window. The red circle closes the window, the yellow circle minimizes the window to the dock in the
lower-right corner of the screen (see Figure 20-3B), and the green circle maximizes the window to full-screen
size. To exit full-screen mode, move your pointer to the top of the screen. When the circle icons appear, click the
green circle.

Closing an app’s window does not close the app. To quit an app that is active, click the name of the app in the
menu bar, and click Quit at the bottom of the drop-down menu. See Figure 20-4.
Finder
Core 2 Objective 1.10
The Finder window, shown earlier in Figure 20-2 and again in Figure 20-5, functions something like File Explorer in
Windows; use it to find and access files, applications, and macOS utility programs. To open the Finder window, click
it in the dock. Note that the Finder is always running; you can close the Finder window, but you can’t end the Finder
utility. Here are useful things you can do with Finder:
●● Files and folders. To open files and folders, click Documents or some other storage location, such as iCloud
Drive or Downloads. Double-click a folder to drill down into it, and double-click a document file to open it.
You can drag and drop a file or folder into and out of a folder or location window.

●● Locations. As shown on the left side of Figure 20-6, available locations are the Mac, the internal hard drive
(Macintosh HD), a USB drive, Remote Disc, and the network. Drill down into any of these locations to see
available resources. When you drill down into Network, you see network devices and their shared resources.
●● Finder menu bar. To use the Finder menu bar to list devices and other resources, click Go in the Finder
menu bar, and click Computer. The Computer window shows all locations and storage devices, and you can
drill down into them. To control what appears in the Finder sidebar or on the desktop, click Finder in the
menu bar, and then click Preferences.
●● Tags. Tags are used to assign a tag or color to a file or folder to make it easier to find later. For example, you
can secondary-click a file, and use the shortcut menu to assign it a blue tag. (A secondary-click is a tap of the
trackpad with two fingers.) Later, click the blue tag in the left column of Finder to see all items with blue tags.
If you use an app, such as GarageBand, frequently, you can add it to the dock or desktop. In Finder, click Applications,
and then click and drag the app’s icon to the dock or desktop. To remove an icon from the dock or desktop, click and
drag the icon to the Trash icon.
Note 1
Launchpad
Core 2 Objective 1.10
Launchpad (see Figure 20-7), which is somewhat similar to a combination of the Windows Start menu and Programs
and Features window, shows all apps installed on the computer. Use one of these methods to open Launchpad:
●● Use the dock. Click the Launchpad icon in the dock.
●● Use a gesture. Pinch with three fingers and your thumb on the trackpad.
●● Use a key. Press the Launchpad key at the top of the Mac keyboard.

In the Launchpad window shown in Figure 20-7, notice the two dots above the dock, which indicate that
Launchpad requires two screens to show all installed apps. Swipe left or right with two fingers to move through
the screens.
Here are some tips on how to use Launchpad:
●● Click an app to open it, which also closes Launchpad.
●● To uninstall an app, press and hold the Option ( ) key, which causes the app icons to jiggle. Click an X on
an icon to uninstall its app. You can also rearrange jiggling icons, similar to the way you can work with icons
on an iPad and iPhone. Release the Option key when you’re done.
●● To close Launchpad and return to the desktop, use a pinch gesture with three fingers and your thumb
spread apart.
Apple Menu
Core 2 Objective 1.10
The menu at the top of the macOS screen changes with each application that is active—except for the Apple icon,
which is always shown at the far left of the menu bar. The Apple menu (see Figure 20-8) opens when you click the
Apple icon. Use the Apple menu to put the computer to sleep, log out, restart, or shut down the system.
Figure 20-8 The Apple menu is always available no matter which
application is active
Source: Apple Inc.
The Apple menu also provides access to system information, system preferences, the App Store, recent
items, and the Force Quit option. Similar to ending a task from Task Manager in Windows, you can force quit
an app by clicking Force Quit. In the Force Quit Applications window (see Figure 20-9), select the app, and
click Force Quit. The application closes. You can also access the Force Quit Applications window by pressing
Command (z)1Option1Esc.

Mission Control and Multiple Desktops
Core 2 Objective 1.10
Mission Control gives you a quick view of all open windows and desktops and lets you switch among them. The
macOS includes a feature called multiple desktops—which, as its name indicates, is several desktop screens, each
with its own collection of open windows. Suppose you’re working with several windows for a school project, and
you have a few more windows open for a project at work. You can place the school project windows on one desktop,
called a Space, and place the work project windows on a separate desktop or Space.
To accomplish this, first open Mission Control using one of these methods:
●● Press the Mission Control (F3) key.
●● Click Mission Control in the Launchpad window.
●● Swipe up with three or four fingers on your trackpad.
●● Press Control1up arrow.
A Mission Control window is shown in Figure 20-16. Three desktops have been created on the system, as
you can see in the Spaces bar at the top of the window. Also, when an app is in full-screen mode, it acts as a
separate Space and shows up in the Spaces bar along with desktops. To create a new desktop, drag an open
window into the Spaces bar or click 1 on the right side of the Spaces bar. To delete a desktop, hover over it in
the Spaces bar and click the X. Desktop configurations apply to each user and remain in place even when the
computer is rebooted.

●● Move among desktops. To move among desktops already created as you work, swipe left or right with three
fingers or press Control1left arrow or Control1right arrow.
●● Organize desktops. To help keep your desktops organized, it helps to customize each desktop with a different wallpaper. Go to a desktop and secondary-click. In the menu that appears on the desktop background,
click Change Desktop Background (see Figure 20-17A). The Desktop & Screen Saver window opens. (This
window is one of the tools in System Preferences.) Select your wallpaper and close the window. Wallpaper
settings in other existing desktops won’t be affected.

●● Organize apps in desktops. To help keep your apps organized, you can assign an app to a specific desktop.
Go to that desktop, and secondary-click the app’s icon in the dock (see Figure 20-17B). Select Options, and
then click This Desktop. Later, when you open the app, the selected desktop will appear with the app’s
open window.
iCloud and iCloud Drive
Core 2 Objective 1.10
Looking back at the Finder window shown earlier in Figure 20-5, notice that iCloud Drive is listed in the sidebar
along with other storage locations such as Desktop, Documents, and Downloads. When a user signs in to macOS
for the first time, they are given the opportunity to set up iCloud with their Apple ID, or the setup can be done
later in System Preferences. In System Preferences, you can also control which apps store their data in iCloud
(see Figure 20-18).
If the desktop background you choose isn’t available on your computer yet, click the Cloud Download icon to make
that background available.

the Files app.) You can also access your iCloud content, including iCloud Drive, from any device with a browser by
going to icloud.com and signing in with your Apple ID.
Keychain
Core 2 Objective 1.10
Keychain is the macOS built-in password manager. To open Keychain, go to the Finder window, drill down into the
Applications list, and then click Utilities (refer back to Figure 20-6). Double-click Keychain Access app. From the
Keychain Access window (see the left side of Figure 20-19), you can view, edit, and remove accounts for applications, websites, and servers. You can also manage personal accounts that you’ve added, such as credit card and
bank accounts.

and Local Items keychains are created, and they are empty. If you have Time Machine backups, try to restore the
keychains from backup to recover lost passwords.
Screen Sharing
Core 2 Objective 1.10
In System Preferences, click Sharing to open the Sharing window, where you can set up file and folder sharing on
the network, printer sharing, remote access, and screen sharing. Screen Sharing works like Remote Desktop in
Windows. In the Sharing window (see Figure 20-20), turn on Screen Sharing, and set it up to allow all users or only
certain users that you add.

Screen Sharing uses incoming port 5900. To access a Mac from the Internet, set up port forwarding on your router to
allow incoming traffic on port 5900.
Note 4
Figure 20-20 Screen Sharing makes it easier to collaborate on projects or to
help other users with their computers
Source: Apple Inc.
To use screen sharing, a user of another Mac on the network should be able to see your shared Mac in their
Finder window in the Locations group. They can click your computer, and then click Share Screen. They then have
the opportunity to sign in to your computer with a user name and password recognized by your computer. Using
screen sharing, they can move files and folders between the two computers.
How secure is macOS screen sharing? Some of the content moved between computers is encrypted and some is
not, and you must open an incoming port on your router. Therefore, macOS screen sharing is not as secure as other
types of remote access software. Also, as you’ll recall from the module “Network Security and Troubleshooting,”
third-party remote access apps that use a browser are considered more secure than OS tools that open ports for
incoming traffic initiated from the Internet. Two examples of apps that use browsers and provide encrypted communication are join.me ( join.me) and Zoom (zoom.us).

Remote Disc
Core 2 Objective 1.10
For Macs that have macOS Mojave 10.14 or earlier, Remote Disc is an
option for accessing an optical drive on another computer. If your Mac
has an optical drive, the Sharing window includes the option DVD or
CD Sharing. This feature, called Remote Disc, gives other Mac computers on the network access to the computer’s optical drive. After you
turn on DVD or CD Sharing on a Mac that has an optical drive, go to the
Mac that doesn’t have an optical drive and open Finder. In Finder, click
Remote Disc in the sidebar under Locations (see Figure 20-21). Apple
has retired this feature and no longer supports Remote Disc on macOS
Catalina 10.15 and newer.
You can enable remote disc sharing on a Windows computer to be used with an older Mac. To share a Windows computer’s optical drive with Macs on your network, download and install DVD or CD Sharing Update 1.0 for Windows,
which is available at support.apple.com/kb/DL112?locale=en_US.

Terminal
Core 2 Objective 1.10
Terminal in macOS is similar to a command prompt window in Windows, except Terminal uses UNIX commands
because macOS is based on UNIX. To open Terminal, open Finder, click Applications, double-click the Utilities folder,
and double-click Terminal. The Terminal window opens, as shown in Figure 20-22. Many of the Linux commands you
learn about in the module “Linux and Scripting” work in the macOS Terminal.

macOS Directory Structures
Core 2 Objectives 1.8, 1.10
First let’s learn some of the basics of macOS directory structures. Here are the file systems macOS supports:
●● APFS (Apple File System) is the default file system for SSDs and can also be used for magnetic hard drives.
APFS allocates free space as needed for each volume on the drive. APFS uses the GUID (also called GPT)
partitioning system.
●● The FAT32 and exFAT file systems are supported for compatibility with Windows and Linux.
Windows cannot read from storage devices that are using the APFS file system unless third-party drivers are installed
in Windows.
Note 6
You need to be familiar with the directory structure in macOS. Here are some tips:
●● To see the directory structure, click Go on the Finder menu bar, and then click Computer. In the Finder
window, click the hard drive, which is labeled Macintosh HD in most systems. In Figure 20-23, you can see
the four folders at the root level. (Other folders in the root are hidden.) User data is in the Users folder.
Figure 20-23 Folders visible in the root of the hard drive
Four root folders
Source: Apple Inc.
●● You can also browse the directory structure using the Terminal and Linux commands. In Finder, open
Applications, open Utilities, and double-click Terminal. All commands, as well as file and directory names,
are case sensitive. Use the cd command to move through the directory structure and the ls command to
list files and directories. For example, Figure 20-24 shows the root directory of the Macintosh HD. Compare
Figure 20-23 with Figure 20-24, and notice that some folders that appear in the Terminal window are hidden
in the Finder window. You learn more about these directories later in this module.

File Types
Three common file types you might encounter while supporting macOS are the following:
●● DMG. A DMG file (.dmg) is a disk image file, similar to an ISO file used in Windows. DMG files can be used
for delivering software. DMG files appear as a virtual disk drive on macOS. When you double-click a DMG
file, the virtual disk is mounted to macOS, and you can then access the files inside it.
●● PKG. A PKG file (.pkg) is a package file, similar to a setup.exe file used in Windows. A PKG file contains
installer files used for software installations. A PKG file is often compressed like a ZIP file, which is used in
Windows. After an installation is complete, the PKG file can be deleted.
●● APP. An APP file (.app) is an application file, similar to a .exe file used in Windows to run an application.

Install and Uninstall Apps in macOS
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.10
Follow these steps to install an app from the App Store:
1. Open the App Store.
2. Browse or search for the app you want to install. As an example, search for Adobe Lightroom, an app
used to manage and edit photos. Click the app name to view the app’s ratings, description, and reviews.
Applying Concepts
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to be able to identify .dmg, .pkg, and .app files. Remember that file names are case
sensitive in macOS.
Installing Apps
Core 2 Objective 1.10
Recall from the module “Mobile Device Security” that Apple streamlines installing apps in Apple devices through its
App Store. The App Store is a central location where you can find, install, support, and update apps. macOS allows
for apps to be installed from trusted sources, such as a developer’s website, but the most reliable method to install
a new app is through the App Store. If you must download an app from a trusted website, always make sure you’re
choosing the file that is made for macOS and not Windows or Linux.

3. Click Get, then Install. If required, provide your Apple ID and password to continue with the installation.
4. When the installation is complete, in the App Store click Open to open Adobe Lightroom.
Uninstalling an app is just as easy. Follow these steps to uninstall an app that was installed by the App Store:
1. Open Launchpad, and find the icon for the app you want to uninstall. In this case, let’s uninstall Adobe
Lightroom, which we just installed.
2. Press and hold the Option key or the app icon until the apps jiggle.
3. Click the Delete key, or the X in the corner of the app icon. Then click Delete. The app is uninstalled.
To install an app from a trusted website, do the following steps:
Browse to the trusted website to download the file. For example, go to
papercut.com/products/free-software/mobility-print/#downloadSection, and download the PaperCut Mobility
Print app for macOS, seen in Figure 20-25.
Figure 20-25 Select the macOS download from trusted sources
4. Open the DMG file in the Downloads folder in Finder.
5. Double-click the PKG file to start the installation, and click Install. Follow the on-screen instructions to
complete the installation.
If an app was installed without using the App Store, you must use Finder to uninstall it. Follow these steps to
uninstall an app:
1. Open Finder and click Applications in the left pane.
2. Find the app you want to uninstall—for example, PaperCut Mobility Print. Drag and drop the app icon to
Trash in the dock.
3. Provide your credentials to allow the uninstallation.
4. Empty Trash.

Note 7
Managed Apple IDs
Core 2 Objective 1.10
Recall from the module “Installing Windows” that you can sign in to Windows using a local account, a Microsoft
account (possibly for Azure), or an AD network ID. Remember that an AD network ID or a Microsoft account can be
used to join a domain. The same applies to macOS. You can sign in to a Mac using a local account, an Apple ID, a
Managed Apple ID, or an AD network ID. A Managed Apple ID and an AD network ID are used to join a domain. For
personal accounts, use a local account or an Apple ID. The Apple ID creates continuity among Apple devices—as a
Microsoft account does across Windows devices.
If a user has already connected their iCloud account, then they have signed in with their Apple ID. If they have
not, then they can set up their Apple ID in System Preferences. Follow these steps with an sign in with an Apple ID:
1. Open System Preferences. Click Sign In.
2. As shown Figure 20-26, you can sign in with your Apple ID if you already have one, or you can create an
Apple ID if necessary. If you don’t remember your password, click Forgot Apple ID or password? to look
up your Apple ID or reset your password.
Figure 20-26 Sign in with Apple ID to access your data stored in iCloud
Source: Apple Inc.
3. When you sign in, you may be prompted to enter the password for your local account or to verify a
passcode sent to a trusted device, such as a mobile phone.
To sign in using a Managed Apple ID, which must be an email address, simply use the Managed Apple ID
credentials provided by your administrator. Upon signing in the first time, you will be prompted to change the
password. The administrator of the Managed Apple IDs through Apple Business Manager is able to put restrictions
on the Apple devices by assigning role privileges. Apple Business Manager is accessed through an Apple website
(business.apple.com).
Apple Business Manager must be connected to a verified domain service, such as Azure AD, which can offer
more control on restrictions based on the capabilities of the domain service you are using. When using Azure AD,
the Azure AD credentials can be used as Managed Apple ID credentials.

Update macOS and Drivers
Core 2 Objective 1.10
Just like Windows, macOS needs regular updates. Updates often address zero-day vulnerabilities, which makes these
updates important to maintaining a healthy system. However, sometimes the updates themselves introduce bugs,
which is why many Mac experts advise against setting macOS updates to install automatically. Instead, wait a few
days after a macOS update is released before manually installing the update; this gives you a chance to see if the
update introduces any significant issues. These updates also include any firmware updates available.
You can access macOS updates in System Preferences. To manually update macOS, open System Preferences,
then click Software Update in the left pane. Figure 20-27 shows a recently updated app. Any available OS updates
will be shown near the top of the screen.
Figure 20-27 The Updates window shows recently installed updates and needed updates
when available
Source: Apple Inc.
Updates for apps are found in the App Store. To manually update apps, click the App Store icon in the dock, and
then click Updates in the left pane. Any apps that need updates are listed in the Updates window.
Printer, scanner, and graphics driver updates are usually included in macOS updates. Other devices that require drivers, if not included in macOS, can be downloaded from the manufacturer’s website and installed. These drivers will
not be updated through macOS updates. If any problems are encountered with these devices, you’ll need to check the
manufacturer’s website for updates.

To change the settings for automatic updates, open System Preferences, and click Software Update. The OS
checks for and reports available updates. For automatic updates, check Automatically keep my Mac up to date. To
change detailed update settings, click Advanced (see Figure 20-28). Here is an explanation of each option:
●● Check for updates. Automatically check for updates.
●● Download new updates when available. Download available updates without installing them.
●● Install macOS updates. Install all updates to the operating system without first requiring user approval.
●● Install app updates from the App Store. Install all updates to App Store applications without first requiring
user approval.
●● Install system data files and security updates. Install critical system patches that address known
vulnerabilities.
Although Macs are not attacked by malware as often as Windows systems are, it’s still important to protect a Mac by
installing and maintaining anti-malware software. Products to consider are Avast Free Mac Security (avast.com), Sophos
Home Premium for Mac (sophos.com), and Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac (trendmicro.com/mac).

Back Up and Restore with Time Machine
Core 2 Objective 1.10
Like iOS mobile devices, Mac computers can use iCloud Drive to store files and folders in the cloud and sync this
content across all of your devices. Unlike the mobile devices you learned about in the module “Supporting Mobile
Devices,” Mac computers cannot be fully backed up using iCloud. For this purpose, macOS includes Time Machine,
which is a built-in backup utility that automatically backs up user-created data, applications, and the entire macOS
system. You can back up to the following:
●● A USB or Thunderbolt external hard drive or a USB flash drive
●● Another Mac on the local network
●● Network-attached storage (NAS) devices that support Time Machine
After Time Machine is set up, backups are updated in the background. Depending on the space available on the
backup drive, Time Machine keeps hourly backups for 24 hours, daily backups for a month, and weekly backups
until the disk is full. The oldest backups are deleted to make space for new backups. You can also set up multiple
backup schedules for more than one backup device.

To set up Time Machine in macOS, open System Preferences, and click Time Machine. The Time Machine window appears, as shown in Figure 20-29.
Figure 20-29 Configure Time Machine backups
Follow the on-screen directions to select a backup disk and configure backup options. Note that everything
already on the disk will be erased. The original backup will be at least 20 GB, includes the entire macOS volume,
and takes some time to complete.
When your Mac is not connected to the backup disk, Time Machine stores backup copies, called local snapshots, of
created, modified, or deleted files on the hard drive. When you reconnect the computer to the backup disk, the local
snapshots are copied to the backup disk. Local snapshots stay on the hard drive as long as they don’t take up too much
space, and they can be restored from the hard drive if needed. Time Machine saves one snapshot each day and one
weekly snapshot for each week the backup disk is disconnected.
Note 10
You can use the backups to recover files, folders, or the entire macOS volume. To recover a file or folder from
Time Machine, open Finder. In the Applications group, double-click Time Machine. The timeline and available
backups in Finder appear (see Figure 20-30). Use the Finder window to locate the file or folder. Then go back through
time to find the version of the file or folder you want to restore. To move through time, you can use the timeline on
the right, the arrow buttons, or click a Finder window in the stack of available windows. Select the item, and click
Restore.

●● Install updates. Regularly check for and install macOS and app updates, which you learned to do earlier in
this module.
●● Verify no startup items. Programs that automatically launch at startup are called startup items, and programs that automatically launch after a user logs in are called login items. Apple discourages the use of
startup items because they slow down the startup process, and items in the startup folder might be malware.
You can verify that the system doesn’t have startup items by looking in two directories that can contain
them: /Library/StartupItems and /System/Library/StartupItems (see Figure 20-33).
●● Free up space. Maintain at least 15%–20% free space on the hard drive for optimal performance. To see how
much free space is available on the drive, open the Apple menu, click About This Mac, and then click the
Storage tab, as shown in Figure 20-32.

Note 12
Many of these same steps can also help when troubleshooting kernel panics. A kernel panic is similar to a BSOD
in Windows. It might be caused by something simple, such as a crashed app or a network communication issue,
or it might result from a corrupted macOS installation. macOS restarts automatically when experiencing a kernel
panic. If the kernel panic continues to prompt restarts, macOS will stop trying and shut down the computer after
five attempts.

Core 2 Objective 1.10
Starting the computer in Safe Mode can solve problems when the computer won’t start due to file system errors or
corrupted startup or login items. Safe Mode in macOS loads essential kernel components, prevents startup items
and login items from launching, and loads a minimum of user processes. It also verifies the startup disk and repairs
any file system errors it finds.

After you select an option, click Continue. Here are the options you’ll see:
●● Restore from Time Machine. Plug in the external hard drive that holds the Time Machine backup, then
select this option, and follow the on-screen directions.
●● Reinstall macOS. The latest macOS that was installed on the computer is downloaded from the Internet and
reinstalled. As you follow the on-screen directions, the computer will reboot several times. If errors occur
during the process, try erasing the hard drive and reinstalling again. After the new installation of macOS
boots up, any data backed up with Time Machine can be restored.
●● Disk Utility. If you need to erase the hard drive (for example, before you give away a Mac), select Disk Utility,
and follow the on-screen directions.
Suppose you are attempting to reinstall macOS from the Internet and you are not able to get an Internet connection
through Wi-Fi or Ethernet. In this situation, you can use another Mac to create a bootable installation device and use it
to reinstall macOS. This bootable device is created using commands in the Terminal window and is not covered in this
text. The commands and process can be found at support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372.

Real Problems, Real Solutions
Killing a Process in macOS
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.10
macOS Terminal is a powerful tool and can be used to kill a hung process or to kill a process you suspect to be malware. First, try to use Force Quit to end the process. If that doesn’t work, use Terminal to end the process. Follow
these general directions to practice this skill:
1. Once again, install the Evernote app, but don’t launch it.
2. Open Terminal. Run the following command to list all running processes (the x option displays all
processes, even those not started in this shell or user interface): ps x
3. Leave Terminal open. Launch the Evernote app. Return to the Terminal window, and list all running
processes again. What are the Evernote app process IDs? Of the two process IDs, which one represents the
application itself, and which one represents a login item?
4. The pgrep command combines the functionality of ps and grep. The grep command searches for text within
a file. Do research online to find the Apple “man page,” or manual page, for pgrep. What do the –f and –l
options do?
5. Confirm the Evernote app’s process IDs with the command pgrep –f –l Evernote. (Be sure to
capitalize the E in Evernote.) Do the process IDs match the information you found earlier?
6. Use Terminal to kill the Evernote app (not the login item).
7. Return to the macOS desktop and uninstall Evernote.

Introduction
In this module, you learn about the Linux operating system and scripting. Linux is commonly used in data centers,
and, increasingly, it is being used in cloud infrastructures around the world. Being familiar with the interface and
basic administrative functions of Linux is important for an IT technician. This module also covers the fundamentals
of scripting used in many scripting languages and environments and presents examples of scripts that can be used
to automate repetitive tasks.
Linux Operating System
Core 2 Objectives 1.8, 1.11, 4.9
A variation of UNIX is Linux (pronounced “Lih-nucks”), an OS created by Linus Torvalds when he was a student at
the University of Helsinki in Finland. Basic versions of this OS are open source, and all the underlying programming
instructions (called source code) are freely distributed. Linux is popular because it’s inexpensive and very stable
(it seldom crashes). Linux is used as an OS for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and even IoT devices. It’s the most
popular OS for server applications such as web servers and email servers. In addition, Android and Chrome OS for
mobile devices are based on Linux, and bootable CDs and flash drives that contain utility software often use Linux.
Versions of Linux are called distributions or flavors; the more popular ones for desktops and servers are listed in
Table 21-1. Hardware requirements for Linux vary widely by distribution.

Arch Linux Arch Linux must be manually configured. It has excellent online
documentation and community support, and Linux professionals
appreciate its simplicity.

Fedora Fedora has been around for a long time and is backed by a
stable company. When updates are released, they tend to work
well without errors. It’s a great distribution for just about any OS
purpose.

Linux itself is not a complete operating system; it is only the kernel for the OS. You also need a shell for user and
application interfaces, and Linux shells vary widely by distributions. Many distributions of Linux include a GUI shell
or desktop, which is called a windows manager. For example, Figure 21-1 shows the desktop or windows manager
for Ubuntu Desktop. Some distributions of Linux designed for server applications don’t have a windows manager.
For example, Ubuntu Server installs with only a command-line interface. In this module, we use Ubuntu Desktop and
Ubuntu Server as our sample Linux distributions.
For more information on Linux, see linux.org as well as the websites of the different Linux distributors.
Note 1

You can install Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Server in a VM or on a hard drive, CD, or USB flash drive. When you
install Ubuntu on a CD or USB flash drive, it is called a Live CD or Live USB. A Live CD or USB can boot up a live version of Linux, complete with Internet access and all the tools you normally have available in a hard drive installation
of Linux, but without installing the OS on the hard drive.
Let’s first install and explore Ubuntu Desktop with its graphical interface, and then you’ll learn to install and use
Ubuntu Server with its command-line interface.

Installing Ubuntu Desktop in a VM
Est. Time: 1 hour
Core 2 Objectives: 1.8, 1.11
Follow these steps to install Ubuntu Desktop in a VM:
1. Recall that you learned how to install a hypervisor and create a VM in the module “Installing Windows.” If
you don’t already have a hypervisor installed, install one that you can use to manage VMs. For example, in
64-bit Windows 10/11 Pro, you can use the Programs and Features window to enable Client Hyper-V, which
comes embedded in the OS. Alternately, you can download and install one of these free hypervisors:
● Oracle VirtualBox at virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
● VMware Workstation Player at https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/info/slug/
desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/16_0
2. Go to ubuntu.com/download/desktop and download the free Ubuntu Desktop OS to your hard drive.
The file that downloads is an ISO file.
3. Open your hypervisor software, and create a new VM with at least 4 GB of RAM and at least a 25 GB
virtual hard drive capacity. Mount the ISO file that contains the Ubuntu Desktop download to a virtual
DVD in your VM.
4. Start up the VM, and install Ubuntu Desktop in the VM, accepting all default settings. Be sure to write
down the name of the VM and your Ubuntu host name, Ubuntu user name, and password. When given
the option, decline to install any extra software bundled with the OS. If needed, the software can be
installed later.
5. When asked to restart the VM, first dismount (remove) the ISO file from the optical drive so the VM boots
to the hard drive. After Ubuntu Desktop launches, log in with your user name and password. Figure 21-2
shows the desktop with the Settings window active and the Network setting selected. To open this
window, click the Apps button, and then click Settings. When a window is active, its menu appears at the
top of the screen. Also notice the System menu is displayed. To open the System menu, click the system
icons area in the upper-right corner of the screen.
6. Take a few minutes to poke around the desktop. You’ll see how it resembles macOS in many ways. For
example, to open a terminal window where you can enter Linux commands, click Activities, and type
terminal in the search box. Click Terminal in the list that appears. Using the terminal, you can enter
Linux commands to manage and support the OS.
Applying Concepts
Ubuntu Desktop is only available as a 64-bit OS. To install a 64-bit guest OS in a VM, the host OS must also be
64 bit. As of this publication, the LTS (long-term support) Ubuntu version is 20.04.3.
Note 2
If you need help learning to use your hypervisor of choice, try searching for some tutorial videos at youtube.com
or on the hypervisor manufacturer’s website.

about using Ubuntu Desktop.
Linux Installs, Updates, and Backups
Core 2 Objective 1.11
When supporting a Linux system, an IT technician needs to know how to install software, update the OS and apps,
and create and maintain scheduled backups. Here are a few details to get you started:
● Install software. To install software, click the Ubuntu Software icon. Ubuntu Desktop software opens. Click
an item and then click Install to start its installation. You can also install an app by clicking a setup file you
have downloaded from the web.
● Update Ubuntu and apps. To update, click Updates in the Ubuntu Software window. Updates for Ubuntu are
listed first, followed by app updates. Click Install beside the updates you want to install. Figure 21-3 shows
that no updates are available.
● Change update settings. To change update settings, open the Apps menu, and click Software & Updates in
the drop-down list. Then click the Updates tab in the Software & Updates window (see Figure 21-4).

● Antivirus and anti-malware solutions. As with every computing environment, you should protect your
Linux system with an antivirus or anti-malware solution. Examples of solutions that have been developed
specifically for Linux include the ClamAV, Comodo, and Sophos applications. An antivirus solution should
be updated regularly to ensure system protection is maintained. Some vendors provide updates multiple
times a week or even daily. Externally connected media and downloaded files should be scanned to minimize
the threat of malware infecting your system.

Installing ClamAV
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.11
To use ClamAV to protect your previously installed VM installation of Ubuntu against malware, follow these steps:
1. Launch your VM, and log in using your root credentials.
2. Open a terminal window, and update your system by running the following command:
sudo apt-get update
3. After your system is updated, run the following command to install ClamAV:
sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon
4. Press Enter when prompted to continue. (Because the Y is uppercase, as shown in Figure 21-7, the default
answer to the prompt is Yes.) After the installation finishes, enter the following command to confirm that
ClamAV was installed correctly:
clamscan --version
If a version shows for ClamAV, then the installation was successful. In Figure 21-8, we can see the current
version of ClamAV is 0.103.2.
Applying Concepts

Figure 21-7 Installing ClamAV on Ubuntu
Now that you have learned some of the basics about Ubuntu Desktop and have installed an antivirus solution,
let’s turn our attention to Ubuntu Server.
Installing and Exploring Ubuntu Server
Core 2 Objectives 1.8, 1.11
Ubuntu Server does not include a windows manager but instead uses a command-line interface called the terminal.
The default shell for the terminal is the Bash shell, which stands for “Bourne Again Shell” and takes the best features
from two previous shells, the Bourne and Korn shells. In this module, we use Ubuntu Server and its default Bash
shell. In Linux, a command prompt in the terminal is called a shell prompt.

Installing Ubuntu Server in a VM
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objectives: 1.8, 1.11
To practice Linux skills covered in this module, you need an installation of Ubuntu Server. Before you continue with
this module, follow these steps to install Ubuntu Server in a VM on a Windows computer:
1. Go to ubuntu.com/download/server and download the Ubuntu Server OS to your hard drive. The file
that downloads is an ISO file.
2. Open your hypervisor software, and create a new VM. For Ubuntu Server, you’ll need at least 4 GB of RAM
and at least a 25 GB virtual hard drive. For this example, we selected a 50 GB virtual hard disk. Mount the
ISO file that contains the Ubuntu Server download to a virtual DVD in your VM.
3. Start up the VM, and install Ubuntu Server, accepting all default settings until you get to the Guided
storage configuration screen (see Figure 21-9). To improve Ubuntu performance, you can set up a swap
partition, which is used to hold virtual memory. In Linux, a swap file or swap partition can hold virtual
memory, but a swap partition yields better performance. Select Custom storage layout, as shown in the
figure, so you can create three partitions on the hard drive.
Applying Concepts
When installing Ubuntu, use the arrow keys to navigate menus, and press Enter to select. The Esc key takes you
back one level in a menu.
Note 5
Figure 21-9 Partition the hard drive to include a swap file
To find out what shell is the default shell for the Linux system, enter the echo $SHELL command. To find out which
shell you are currently using, enter the echo $0 command.

4. On the next screen, under AVAILABLE DEVICES, select the first device listed, and then press Enter. In the
drop-down menu that appears, select Add GPT Partition, as shown in Figure 21-10.
5. In the Adding partition box, enter the size of the boot partition (at least 25 GB), and select the file system
type ext4, as shown in Figure 21-11.
6. Add a second partition, and select swap as the file system type. Make the partition size a little larger than
the amount of installed memory. Figure 21-12 shows the resulting Storage configuration screen with
three partitions created. Notice that not all the hard drive is partitioned in our example:

● Partition 1. The small BIOS grub spacer partition is automatically created and is used to boot the
system in a dual-boot environment. GRUB (GR and Unified Bootloader) is a boot loader used to
manage dual-boot systems.
● Partition 2. The 40 GB partition that will hold the OS uses the ext4 file system.
● Partition 3. The 5 GB swap partition is used to hold virtual memory. A swap partition does not have a
file system installed.
7. Select Done to complete the installation, accepting all defaults. Be sure to write down the name of the VM
and your Ubuntu host name, Ubuntu user name, and password. When given the option, decline to install
any extra software bundled with the OS. Notice this software includes add-ons to be used when Ubuntu
Server is installed in the cloud using Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. If needed, the software can
be installed later.
8. After the VM restarts, Ubuntu Server launches, and you should see the terminal shell in the VM. See
Figure 21-13.
9. You might need to press Enter to see the shell prompt. Then enter your user name and password, and
you’re logged in to Ubuntu Server. In Figure 21-13, the server is named spock and the logged-in user
is evan. Notice that Ubuntu reports that six packages can be updated. In Ubuntu, a package is the
collection of files needed to install software.
10. When you are ready to shut down Ubuntu Server, run the sudo shutdown now command.
Typically, the shell prompt includes the user name, host name, and the current directory, followed by a $. For
example, in Figure 21-13, the shell prompt shows the user name is evan, and the host name is spock. The ~ character
indicates the user’s home directory, which for the evan account is /home/evan. When you first log in to Linux, the
current directory is always the home directory of the logged-in user. (In Linux, directories in a path are separated
with forward slashes, in contrast to the backward slashes used by Windows.)

It’s easiest to install a swap partition when you install Ubuntu. If Ubuntu is installed on a single partition on
the hard drive and you want to improve performance later, you can shrink the Ubuntu partition and create a swap
partition in the free space. This text does not cover how to do that.
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to know that a swap partition improves performance and that you can create one
during or after the installation. You also need to know about the ext4 and ext3 file systems.
As you learn to use Ubuntu, know that the help.ubuntu.com website contains a wealth of information about Ubuntu
and links to even more help.

Recall from the module “The Complex World of IT Professionals” that each OS has file systems it can support.
Linux file systems include:
● ext4. The current Linux file system is ext4 (fourth extended file system). This is why you selected ext4 when
you installed Ubuntu Desktop and Server.
● ext3. The ext3 file system was the first to support journaling, which is a technique that tracks and stores
changes to the hard drive and helps prevent file system corruption.
● FAT32 and NTFS. The FAT32 and NTFS file systems are supported for compatibility with Windows and
macOS. Windows can use either FAT32 or NTFS, and macOS can use FAT32. Ubuntu should not be installed
on a FAT32 or NTFS volume.

On a local network or in a dual boot with Windows and Linux, you might want to access files in either volume from
either OS. Know that Linux can access the NTFS file system on the Windows volume, but Windows cannot access the
ext4 file system on the Linux volume. You can, however, install third-party software, such as Paragon ExtFS for Windows
(paragon-software.com), to access the ext4 volume.
Note 7
Directory Description
/bin Contains programs and commands necessary to boot the system and perform other system
tasks not reserved for the administrator, such as shutdown and reboot.
/boot Consists of components needed for the boot process, such as boot loaders.
/dev Holds device names, which consist of the type of device and a number identifying the device;
actual device drivers are located in the /lib/modules /[kernel version]/ directory.
/etc Contains system configuration data, including configuration files and settings and their
subdirectories; these files are used for tasks such as configuring a user account, changing system
settings, and configuring a domain name resolution service. This directory should be backed up
on a regular basis.
/home Contains user data; every user of the system has a directory in the /home directory, such as
/home/evan or /home/robyn, and when a user logs in, that directory becomes the current
working directory. This directory should be backed up on a regular basis to protect user-saved
documents and files.
/lib Stores common libraries used by applications so more than one application can use the same
library at one time; an example is the library of C programming code, without which only the
kernel of the Linux system could run.
/lost1found Stores data that is lost when files are truncated or when an attempt to fix system errors is
unsuccessful.
/opt Contains installations of third-party applications such as web browsers that do not come with the
Linux OS distribution; this directory should be included in your regular backups.
/root Serves as the home directory for the root user and contains only files specific to the root user;
don’t confuse this directory with the root, which contains all the directories listed in this table.
This directory should also be backed up to ensure a copy of the root user account is saved.
/sbin Stores commands required for system administration, with root-level privileges required.
/tmp Stores temporary files, such as the ones that applications use during installation and operation.
/usr Contains executable programs, libraries, and shared resources that are not critical to the Ubuntu
system; this directory and two subdirectories should be backed up. Those subdirectories
(/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin) may include applications that have been installed and are not part
of the /usr parent directory.
/var Holds variable data such as logs, email, news, print spools, and administrative files; this directory
should also be backed up on a regular basis.
Table 21-2 Important directories in a typical Linux root directory
As you read along and learn about Linux commands, you can use your Ubuntu VMs to practice these commands.
Directory Structures
Table 21-2 lists some important directories that are created in the root during a typical Linux installation. (Some
distributions of Linux modify the directory structure.) Not all directories in the root are listed in the table. You will
need to be familiar with the directories list in Table 21-2 and understand their uses.

Exploring Directories and Files
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.11
Let’s learn a few Linux commands that we can use to explore directories and files. As shown in Figure 21-14, enter
these commands:
1. Open a new terminal window, or run the clear command to clear an existing window of all its clutter.
2. Enter the pwd command (print working directory) to display the full path to the current directory, which is
/home/evan in the figure.
3. Run the cd .. command to move up one directory to /home. (Note the space after the d.)
4. Run the ls command to display the list of files and subdirectories in the /home directory. Notice in the
figure that the one subdirectory in the /home directory is evan.
5. Enter the ls -l command to display the results using the long format. (Note the space after the s.) As
you can see in the figure, the results are as follows:
drwxr-xr-x 3 evan evan 4096 Sep 18 02:20 evan
Here is an explanation of the types of information in the list:
● Attributes. The first 10 characters (drwxr-xr-x) define the file or directory attributes. The first character
identifies the type of item: A “d” is a directory, “a –” is a regular file, and a “1” indicates the item is a link to
another location. The other nine characters (“rwxr-xr-x”) define the read, write, and execute permissions
assigned to the file or directory; these permissions are explained in detail later in the module.

Root Account and User Accounts
A Linux system administrator is responsible for installing updates to the OS (called patches), managing backups,
installing software and hardware, setting up user accounts, resetting passwords, and generally supporting the OS
and users. To accomplish this, they require root privileges or access to all the functions of the OS. Two ways Linux
allows for root privileges are as follows:
● Superuser. The principal user account is called the root account. Notice in Figure 21-14 that all the directories and files in the root directory belong to the root account. When logged in to the root account, the user
is called the superuser. Because the root account is so powerful, Ubuntu disables login to this account by
default. The root account is similar to the Windows Administrator account.
● Regular user account with root privileges. Any user account can be assigned root privileges. If the user
has root privileges, they can execute any command that requires root access by adding sudo to the beginning of the command line. An account with root privileges is similar to a Windows account that has been
assigned administrative rights.
The command to switch users is su. To switch to the root account, use the command sudo su root, as shown
in Figure 21-15.
Figure 21-15 The user account, host name, and
current directory appear in the shell
prompt, along with a # or $ to indicate
the root account or other account
Notice in the figure that the shell prompt changes to root@spock:/#. The Linux command prompt for the root
user is different from the command prompt for regular users. The root command prompt is #, and other users have
the $ command prompt. To switch back to the evan account, use the command su evan. As a general practice, never
log in to Linux as root unless you have no other option; you can do a lot of damage as root.
Linux Commands
Table 21-3 describes some basic Linux commands, together with simple examples of how some are used. As you
read along, be aware that all commands entered in Linux are case sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase
matter. You can practice these commands in a Ubuntu VM, or you can practice the commands by booting a computer
from the Live Ubuntu bootable USB drive you created in the Core 1 module “Hard Drives and Other Storage Devices.”
● Links. The second column lists the number of links the item has, which is three in our example. In
Linux, a link is similar to a Windows shortcut to a file or directory.
● Owners. The third column lists the user owner, and the fourth column lists the group that owns the file
or directory. In Figure 21-14, the owner is evan, and the owner group is also evan.
● Size, date, and name. The last columns list the size of the file or directory in bytes, the date the item
was last modified, and the name of the file or directory. The name of directory, evan, is listed in blue.
6. Enter the cd .. command again to move up to the main directory in Linux, called the root directory,
which is indicated with a forward slash. Run the ls -l command to list the files and subdirectories in
the root.

Command Description
adduser Add a user to a system:
adduser <username>
apt-get Install and remove applications and other programs (called packages) in Linux. When
you first install Linux, it installs with only a bare-bones set of commands and utilities,
and it includes a library of packages that you can install as needed. For example, to
install the SSH (Secure Shell) package so you can remotely connect to your Linux server:
sudo apt-get install ssh
The apt-get command requires root access, which means you must precede the command
with sudo.
cat View the contents of a file. Many Linux commands can use the redirection symbol > to
redirect the output of the command. For example, use the redirection symbol with the cat
command to copy a file:
cat /etc/shells > newfile
The content of the shells file is written to newfile.
cd Change the directory.
To change the directory to /etc:
cd /etc
To move up one level in the directory tree:
cd ..
To go to the root:
cd /
chmod Change modes (or permissions) for a file or directory. You’ll see several examples of this
command later in the module.
chown Change the owner of a file or directory.
To change the owner of /mystuff to root:
chown root /mystuff
clear Clear the screen. This command is useful when the screen has become cluttered with
commands and data that you no longer need to view.
cp Copy a file:
cp <source> <destination>
df Show the amount of disk free space available in Linux and to understand the file systems
that are attached, or mounted, to the system. Use the df (disk file system) command with
no parameters to report file system device names, free space, and mount points:
df
dig Query for DNS information. This is similar to the Windows command nslookup. To lookup
the DNS information for linux.org:
dig linux.org
echo Display information on the screen. You can also save the information to a file. For example,
to create a new file that contains text:
echo “Hello World” > myfile
exit Log out; the login shell prompt appears, and you can log in again.

Command Description
find “Walk” through the file hierarchy to find files and directories. To find a file, the syntax of the
command is as follows:
find <directoryname> -name <filename>
grep Search for a specific pattern in a file or in multiple files. This command is useful when
searching through long log files:
grep <pattern> <file>
ifconfig Troubleshoot problems with TCP/IP network connections. This command can disable and
enable network adapters and assign a static IP address to an adapter. For example, to show
all configuration information:
ifconfig –a
To enable or disable an adapter, use the up or down parameter. For example, to enable
eth0, the first Ethernet interface:
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
To assign a static IP address to the eth0 interface:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.90
ip Display IP addresses and property information of the various network interfaces on the
system. This command can also be used to configure and modify routes, tunnel over IP,
and modify the interface statuses. Many Linux distributions have moved to the ip command
rather than using ifconfig.
For example, to show the ip address information:
ip a
or
ip addr
To assign the 192.168.1.100 ip address and 255.255.255.0 subnet mask to the eth0
interface:
ip a add 192.168.1.100/255.255.255.0 dev eth0
iwconfig Display information about the wireless adapter’s configuration or to change the
configuration. This command works like ifconfig but applies only to wireless networks. To
set the wireless NIC to Ad-Hoc mode so other devices within range can connect directly to
it, use this command, where wlan0 identifies the wireless adapter:
iwconfig wlan0 mode Ad-Hoc
To force the NIC to use channel 3:
iwconfig wlan0 channel 3
kill Kill a process instead of waiting for it to terminate. Use the ps command to list process IDs.
To end a process, use the kill command followed by the PID. For example, to kill the process
with a PID of 984:
kill 984
The command sends a signal to the process to end itself in an orderly way. If the process
doesn’t die peacefully, you can get the kernel involved to forcefully end the process (this is
called a forced kill):
kill -kill 984

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Command Description
ls Display a list of directories and files (similar to the Windows dir command). For example, to
list files in the /etc directory, use the long parameter for a complete listing:
ls -l /etc
To include hidden files in the list:
ls -la /etc
(Note that in Linux, hidden files begin with a period.)
man Display the online help manual, called man pages. For example, to get information about
the echo command:
man echo
The manual program displays information about the command. To exit the manual
program, type q.
mkdir Make a new directory:
mkdir <directory>
mv Move a file or rename it, if the source and destination are the same directory:
mv <source> <destination>
For example, to move myfile from the evan directory to the home directory:
sudo mv /home/evan/myfile /home/myfile
Note that because the /home directory is owned by the root account, the sudo command is
required.
nano Launch a full-screen editor that can be used to edit a file:
nano <filename>
passwd Change a password. When a user enters the command, they are asked for the old password
and then can change it.
The superuser can change the password for any account and does not need to enter the
account’s old password, making it possible to reset a forgotten password.
ping Test network connections by sending a request packet to a host. If a connection is
successful, the host will return a response packet. For example:
ping 192.168.1.100
The ping results continue until you manually stop the process. Press Ctrl1C to break out of
the process. To specify the number of pings:
ping 192.168.1.100 -c 4
ps Display the process table so you can identify process IDs for currently running processes.
The command stands for “process status.” (Once you know the process ID, you can use the
kill command to terminate a process.)
To list processes of the current user:
ps
To list processes owned by all users:
ps aux
pwd Show the name of the current or present working directory. The command stands for
“print working directory.”
When you first log in to Linux, the directory is /home/username.
rm Remove or delete the file or files that are specified:
rm <file>

Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to be familiar with these Linux commands: apt-get, cat, chmod, chown, cp, df, dig,
find, grep, ip, ls, man, mv, nano, ps, pwd, rm, top, yum.
Command Description
rmdir Remove or delete an empty directory:
rmdir <directory>
shutdown Automatically shut down the system.
To shut down now:
sudo shutdown now
To warn users and then shut down:
sudo shutdown -h 110 “Everyone log out now. The system will shut down in 10 minutes for
maintenance.”
To reboot now:
sudo shutdown -r now
su Switch to a different user account. The command stands for “substitute user” or “switch
user.” When switching to superuser, add sudo to the command.
To switch to the root account:
sudo su root
To switch back to the evan account:
su evan
sudo Run a command as the superuser. The command stands for “substitute user to do the
command,” and it is pronounced “sue-doe” or “sue-doo.” When logged in as a normal
user with an account that has the right to use root commands, you can start a command
with sudo to run the command as the superuser. A user password may be required. For
example:
sudo shutdown now
top Display the Linux processes. This command shows a dynamic, real-time view of the running
processes and threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel.
yum Get, install, delete, and manage software packages in RPM (Red Hat Package Manager).
The yum (Yellowdog Update Manager) command is the primary tool for performing these
functions in RPM. This command is similar to the apt-get update command used in this
module to update distributions such as Ubuntu.
For example, to download updates for all installed software:
sudo yum update
Table 21-3 Some common Linux commands (Continued)
Here are a few tips when using commands at a shell prompt:
● Retrieve previous commands. Press the up arrow key to retrieve previously entered commands and then
edit a command that appears.
● Use wildcard characters. Linux, similar to Windows, can use the * and ? wildcard characters in command
lines. For example, use the ls *.??? command to list all files with a file extension of three characters. In
addition, Linux provides a third wildcard: Brackets can give a choice of characters. For example, use the
ls *.[abc]* command to list all files whose file extension begins with a, b, or c.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
● Redirect output. Normally, output from a command displays on the screen. To redirect that output to a file,
use the redirection symbol >. For example, to redirect the output of the ifconfig command to myfile, use the
ifconfig > myfile command.
● Page the output. Append |more to the end of a command line to display the results of the command on the
screen one page at a time. For example, to page the ls command: ls -l |more.
● Use Ctrl1C. To break out of a command or process, press Ctrl1C. Use it to recover after entering a wrong
command or to stop a command that requires a manual halt.
The Nano Editor
The nano editor is a text editor that allows you to easily make changes to text-based files. In this section, you learn
how to create a text file in the nano editor, edit text, and save your changes.
Let’s create and work with a file called mymemo:
1. You can save a file to your home directory because you own that directory. If you are not already in your
home directory, run the cd command to go there. For example:
cd /home/evan
2. To open the nano editor and create the new file, enter the command nano mymemo. The nano editor
screen appears, and the file name is shown at the top center of the screen.
3. When you first open the nano editor, you can immediately edit the file by typing in the window. Type the
first sentence of step 2 as the text for your memo (see Figure 21-16).
4. At the bottom of the screen are several commands. The carrot (^) symbol is used to represent the
Control (Ctrl) key on your keyboard. To see all the commands available in nano, press Ctrl1G.
5. To save your changes, press Ctrl1O, and then press Enter to save the changes to the listed file name.
To exit, press Ctrl1X. Alternatively, you can just use the Exit command, and nano will ask if you want to
save any changes made to the file.

Installing FTP Server in Ubuntu
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.11
In the following steps, you learn to use several Linux commands to install and configure software and examine a log
file. Follow these steps to set up an FTP server in Ubuntu:
1. Log in to Ubuntu Server with your user name and password.
2. To create a short file to test the FTP server, you can use the echo command with redirection. Create
mymemo2 in your /home/username directory by entering this command:
echo “my typing” > /home/username/mymemo2
3. To install the FTP program named vsftpd, enter this command:
sudo apt-get install vsftpd
4. Respond to the prompts, and then wait for the package to install.
5. Now you need to configure the FTP program by editing the /etc/vsftpd.conf text file. Before you edit the
file, go to the /etc directory and make a backup copy of the file just in case you need it later. The sudo
command is needed because files in the /etc directory belong to root:
cd /etc
sudo cp vsftpd.conf vsftpd.backup
6. Use the nano editor to edit the FTP configuration file:
sudo nano vsftpd.conf
7. Verify and/or change three lines in the file to create the following settings:
● Disable anonymous logins: anonymous_enable=NO
● If necessary, remove the # to uncomment the line, and allow local users to log in:
local_enable=YES
● If necessary, remove the # to uncomment the line, and allow users to write to a directory:
write_enable=YES
Part of the file, including these three lines, is shown in Figure 21-17.

8. Exit the nano editor, saving your changes. Restart the FTP service by running this command:
service vsftpd restart
9. To find out the IP address of the server, type ifconfig. If net-tools are not installed, you will need to
install them.
10. On your host Windows computer, open a command prompt window, and go to a directory on your Windows
computer where you have a file stored. To test your FTP server, open an FTP session using the IP address of
the server—for example: ftp 192.168.128.57 (your IP address may be different). Then enter your user name
and password. The ftp> prompt appears. See Figure 21-18.

11. Next, run the ls -l command to see a list of directories and files. You should see the file mymemo2 that
you created in your /home/username directory earlier.
12. If you want to transfer files with FTP commands, use the get and put commands. To download the
mymemo2 file, run the command get mymemo2. To transfer a file from your Windows computer to your
Ubuntu server, run the put command.
13. Type bye to disconnect from the FTP server. At the Windows command prompt, run the dir m*
command, as shown in Figure 21-18, to verify that the file was received on the Windows computer.
14. Return to Ubuntu Server and examine the FTP log file, /var/log/vsftpd.log. Because the file is short, you can run
the cat command to display the entire log. The sudo command is required because /var files belong to root:
sudo cat /var/log/vsftpd.log

Update Linux from the Shell Prompt
In general, Linux updates don’t come as often as Windows or macOS updates. The creator of your Linux distribution
publishes updates to packages in the current release of a distribution and publishes new releases of a distribution.
When you first log in to the system, Linux reports the package updates that are available (refer back to Figure 21-13).
Run these commands to update the packages previously installed in your system:
1. To refresh the list of all available updates:
sudo apt-get update
2. To update only the installed packages:
sudo apt-get upgrade
A new release of a distribution contains all updates since the last release. As a Linux administrator, you need to
stay aware of the latest release of the distribution you are using and decide when or if it’s appropriate to upgrade to
that release. Before you upgrade to a new release, be sure you have backups of your data and a disk image (called
a clone) of the entire Linux partition.
Here’s how to upgrade to a new release for Ubuntu Server:
1. Follow the previous steps to update all packages installed in the system.
2. To make sure the latest update manager program is installed, enter the command:
sudo apt-get install update-manager-core
3. To install the latest release of Ubuntu Server, enter the command:
sudo do-release-upgrade
If a new release is available, the last command reports it, and you can follow directions to install it.
15. After much activity, log files can get quite long. The grep command can help you find a specific action, user,
IP address, file name, or directory name. For example, to display lines in the log file that contain the text
“LOGIN,” enter this grep command:
sudo grep “LOGIN” /var/log/vsftpd.log
The results of the cat and grep commands are shown in Figure 21-19.
Figure 21-19 The grep command can be used to search for specific text in
log files

Assign Permissions and Ownership of Files or Directories
A file or directory can have read, write, and/or execute permissions assigned to it. Permissions can be assigned
to (a) the owner, (b) other users in the same group as the owner, and (c) all users. The chmod command is used
to manage permissions for files and directories. To see current permissions, examine the 10 characters in the left
column that display when you use the ls -l command. For example, suppose the output for the ls -l command on the
/home/evan directory is that shown in Figure 21-20.
Ubuntu Server does not have an easy-to-use backup service. Normally, the system administrator installs third-party
software, such as Bacula, to perform backups. Another option is to write your own shell scripts, which are similar to
batch files, that include tar commands to create an archive of many files and copy it to other media, such as a USB
drive or network storage. Files recommended for your Linux backup processes are noted in the list of directories in
Table 21-2, presented earlier in the module.

Type of item:

Here is the explanation of these characters:
● The first character identifies the type of item (d is a directory; - is a regular file).
● Characters 2–4 show the permissions assigned to the user or owner (for example, rwx means the user has
read, write, and execute permissions).
● Characters 5–7 show the permissions assigned to the group (for example, r-x means the group has read and
execute permissions, but not write permission).
● Characters 8–10 show the permissions for others (for example, r-x means other users have read and execute
permissions, but not write permission. By contrast, --- would mean others don’t have read, write, or execute
permission).
The chmod command changes these permissions. To change permissions on files and directories, you can use
either the symbolic (characters) format or the absolute (octal numbers 0 through 7) format. Using the example in
Figure 21-20, if the user evan wants to give read, write, and execute permissions to everyone (group and other), he
can use this symbolic formatted command:
chmod g=rwx,o=rwx /home/evan
The g assigns permission to the group, and the o assigns permissions to others. (The u can assign permissions
to the owner.) For a folder, you must move out of the folder before you change its permissions. Also, the command
has no space before or after a comma.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
Let’s look at an example of when you might need to change the ownership of a directory or file. Suppose you
are setting up an FTP server so users who have accounts on the server can use FTP to upload files to their home
directories. Table 21-4 lists commands that might be useful to set up the user directories.
Command Description
sudo adduser hector Creates the user account and its home directory
sudo mkdir /home/hector/files Creates a subdirectory named files for hector to store their files when using
FTP; the sudo command is required to create the directory in another user’s
account, and this new directory belongs to root
sudo chown hector:hector
/home/hector/files
Changes the owner of the files directory. The user:group component of the
command written as hector:hector says that the user owner is hector, and also the
group owner is the hector group. Note there is no space before or after the colon.
sudo chmod u+w, g-w,o-w /home/
hector/files
Gives write permissions to the user, and removes write permissions from the
group and other
Table 21-4 Commands to set up user directories with appropriate write permissions
You can also use an octal format, also known as the absolute method, to change the permissions. The octal
format is used to quickly use octal numbers 0 through 7 to specify the permission values for the user, group, and
others. In the example, chmod 754 myfile, the 754 is broken into a 7 for the user, a 5 for the group, and a 4 for others.
The octal values for the read, write, and execute permissions are as follows:
● 4 stands for “read”
● 2 stands for “write”
● 1 stands for “execute”
● 0 stands for “no permission”
When looking back at the 754 in our example, the user is given full permissions of read, write, and execute
(4 1 2 1 1 5 7). The group is given the read and execute only (4 1 1 5 5), and others are given read only permission (4).
Telnet and SSH for Remote Access
Core 2 Objective 4.9
Recall that Windows uses Remote Desktop and macOS uses Screen Sharing to remotely access a computer with
screen and file sharing. Windows also makes use of SSH for secure remote access, as you learned in the module
“Network Security and Troubleshooting.” In Linux, the primary utilities for remote access at a shell prompt are Telnet
and SSH (Secure Shell). Telnet does not encrypt transmissions, but SSH encrypts all transmissions. Therefore, SSH
is more secure than Telnet and is the most common method to remotely access a Linux system. Use the commands
in Table 21-5 to install Telnet and SSH in Linux.
Command Description
sudo apt-add-repository universe Add the universe repository to the list of places Ubuntu can find apps. This
is an official repository of apps, but it is not supported by Ubuntu. (Note that
when you attempt to add the repository and it is already available, a message
appears, saying the component is already enabled.)
sudo apt-get update Download and update all apps available to Ubuntu, including the ones in the
universe repository.
sudo apt-get install openssh-server Install and run the SSH server in Linux.
sudo apt install telnet Install and run the Telnet server.

In Windows, SSH is enabled by default, and Telnet Client can be turned on using the Windows Features window,
which is available in the Programs and Features window. Here are the steps to remotely access a Linux system from
a Windows or Linux computer:
1. For Telnet using Windows, turn on Telnet Client in the Windows Features window.
2. For Telnet, at a Windows command prompt or Linux shell prompt, run the following command to open a
Telnet session, substituting the IP address for the Linux system you want to remote in to:
telnet 192.168.1.160
3. The Linux login prompt appears. Enter your user name and password. To close the session, run the
logout command.
4. To use SSH to remote in, enter the following command, substituting your user name and IP address for
the remote Linux system:
ssh evan@192.168.1.160
5. Enter your password to log in to Linux. To close the session, run the logout command.
Samba File Servers
Core 2 Objective 1.11
A Linux Samba file server allows for file sharing across different operating systems within a network. The name
Samba comes from the Windows protocol server message block (SMB). Whereas SMB is used solely in a Windows environment for file and printer sharing, Samba provides the ability for Linux-hosted files and printers to
be accessed across the Windows network. Figure 21-21 shows the Samba service running on Ubuntu, and in the
window open toward the bottom of Figure 21-21, you can see the Shoppinglist.txt file that is located on the Ubuntu
hard drive.

to the last topic of the module, scripting.
Scripting Software and Techniques
Core 2 Objective 4.8
In this text, you’ve learned to use commands in a Windows command prompt window and Linux commands within
the Linux terminal. When a technician finds themselves repetitively entering the same group of commands, they
might decide to store them in a text file and execute them as a batch. The text file containing such a list of commands
is called a script; using scripts can save time and ensures consistency (fewer errors). In this part of the module, you
learn about the various script file types and then explore the basics of reading and writing scripts, which will help
get you started using scripts written by others or writing your own scripts.
Figure 21-22 Shoppinglist text file shown in Windows

In Figure 21-22, you can see that same Shoppinglist file being accessed from a Windows operating system. This
is because the file was shared by the Ubuntu system using the Samba service.

Script File Types
In the module “Maintaining Windows,” you learned to create a batch file that contains Windows commands. This
and other script file types are listed in Table 21-6 with a description of the software that can read and interpret each
command in a script file and execute these commands in a run-time environment.
Script File Extension Description
.bat A batch file contains a list of Windows commands that can be executed in a command
prompt window.
.ps1 A PowerShell script contains PowerShell commands, also known as cmdlets, that are
executed in Windows PowerShell. The script is written using dynamic type checking,
which means each cmdlet is checked by the PowerShell interpreter as it is typed to verify
that the command can be executed as it is added to the script file. Many scripting and
programming applications support dynamic type checking.
.vbs A .vbs script is written with VBScript, which is modeled after the more complex Visual
Basic, a full-fledged programming language.
.sh A UNIX or Linux script, also called a shell script, contains Linux commands and is executed
in a UNIX or Linux shell.
.py A Python script is a group of Python commands interpreted by Python. Python can also
compile the commands into an executable program.
.js A .js script written in JavaScript is a text file that contains commands normally used with
webpages. These scripts can be embedded in an HTML file, which is downloaded from a
web server to a browser and used to build an interactive webpage in the browser. To ensure
this works, JavaScript needs to be activated or turned on from the browser settings.
Table 21-6 Types of script files and scripting software
Scripts are simpler to write and use than programs. Differences between a script and a program include the
following:
● A script is interpreted. A script is read, interpreted, and executed command by command directly from the
script file by software called an interpreter. For example, a technician types the commands into a script file,
and the commands are verified to work by PowerShell or VBScript. When a technician executes the script,
PowerShell or VBScript reads, interprets, and executes each command in the file.
● A program is compiled. A program is first written using a programming language such as Visual Basic or
Python, which interprets the code to verify that it can be executed. Then the coding file is compiled by the
Visual Basic or Python complier into a binary executable file that has an .exe file extension. The executable
file can then be run or executed by an operating system.
Basics of Scripting
Ready to learn a little scripting? Let’s get started with some key terms:
An environmental variable (sometimes called a system variable) is information the OS makes available to a
script. For example, the Windows and Linux PATH variable lists the paths (drives, directories, and subdirectories)
With the release of Windows 11, Microsoft now includes the Windows Terminal application, in addition to PowerShell
version 7.2. You can use Windows Terminal to run commands from Command Prompt and cmdlets from PowerShell.
Scripts should still be created in the PowerShell ISE.

the script can use. Another example is the TEMP variable, which tells a script where it can store its temporary files.
To view and edit environmental variables in Windows, open the System window, and click Advanced system settings. On the Advanced tab of the System Properties dialog box, click Environmental Variables. See Figure 21-23.
● Comments are text you put in a script to document the script. They can include your name, the date, the
purpose of the script, and documentation that might help someone understand command lines in the script.
Comment syntax refers to how you tag the text as a comment so it is not interpreted as a command. For
example, in PowerShell, a line in the script file can hold a comment if you begin the line with a #.
● A basic loop executes the same commands multiple times until some condition is met.
● A variable is the name of an unknown data item and can be assigned a value, which is called initializing
the variable. In PowerShell, a variable name is preceded by $. You can assign a value to a variable using the
equal symbol (5).
● A data type determines what type of value a variable can be assigned. Two common data types are integers
(whole numbers) and strings (text).
In the world of scripting and programming, it is common practice that the very first script or program a person
learns how to write does nothing more than say “Hello World.” Although it is a simple program, it proves you know
how to create, save, and execute a script. Let’s create one in a shell script:
1. At an Ubuntu shell prompt, make sure the current directory is your home directory. Then enter this
command, saving the .sh file in your home directory:
echo “echo Hello World” > my-script.sh
2. To assign execute permission to the file, run this command:
chmod u=rwx my-script.sh

3. To execute a shell script, type ./ before the script file name. Enter this command (see Figure 21-24):
./my-script.sh
Now let’s create a PowerShell script with a loop using Windows 10 PowerShell ISE, the PowerShell Integrated
Scripting Environment, where scripts are created and tested:
1. In the Windows 10 search box, type powershell and then click PowerShell ISE. The PowerShell ISE
window opens.
2. PowerShell ISE does dynamic type checking. As the command is interpreted, color coding is added to
indicate the purpose of what you type. Type the following lines in the script pane (see Table 21-7):
3. To execute the script, click the Run Script button, or click File and then click Run. The script is
executed in the lower pane. See Figure 21-25.

4. To save your script, click File, click Save, and save the script to your desktop. Name the script
MyLoopScript. By default, the .ps1 file extension is assigned to the file.
5. Close the PowerShell ISE window, and open a standard PowerShell window.
6. By default, running PowerShell scripts is disabled. To set the execution policy so scripts will run except
those downloaded from the Internet without a valid digital signature, enter this cmdlet:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
7. Run this alias cmdlet to go to your Windows desktop folder:
cd desktop
8. Run the dir alias cmdlet to list the contents of your desktop folder. You should see the script file listed.
9. To execute a PowerShell script, begin with ./. Enter this cmdlet to execute your script:
./MyLoopScript
Those are the basics of scripting. Now, let’s discuss why IT personnel write scripts and examine various instances
when you might want to use a script.
Uses for Scripting
Core 2 Objective 4.8
As you just learned, scripts can be used to write simple programs to perform tasks such as writing the “Hello World”
statement. However, more complicated uses for scripts include the following:
● Restarting systems and services remotely
● Automating various administrative processes such as application installs, updates, and backups
● Remapping network file shares for users to access and save files across the network

Using PowerShell to Assist in System Administration
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 4.8
PowerShell can make Windows system administration easier through automation. In this activity, you will use the
PowerShell ISE to script the following:
● Create a TestUser account without a password
● Create a MyTestDocuments directory in the My Documents folder of the TestUser
● Create four text documents named File1, File2, File3, and File4 in that newly created MyTestDocuments
directory
● Check the status of DHCP Client service
● Restart the Explorer service
● Get a list of all your computer’s information
1. In the Windows 10 search box, type powershell and then click Run as administrator under the
PowerShell ISE. The PowerShell ISE window opens.
2. Run the command Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned in the bottom window. This allows you
to run locally written and signed scripts you get from the Internet.
3. Enter the commands listed in Table 21-8 in the top pane of the PowerShell ISE. After all the commands
have been entered, the screen should look like the one in Figure 21-26.
Applying Concepts
Table 21-8 PowerShell commands to enter for the script
Command Purpose
New-LocalUser -Name “TestUser”
-NoPassword
Creates a new local user named TestUser and sets
the account to not have a password
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group “Users”

“directory”
Creates a new directory named MyTestDocs in the
TestUser’s Documents directory
(“File1.txt”, “File2.txt”, “File3.txt”,
“File4.txt” | foreach { New-Item
-Path “C:\Users\TestUser\Documents\
MyTestDocs” -Name “$_”})
Uses a foreach loop to create four new text files in
the previously created MyTestDocs directory
Get-Service -DisplayName ‘DHCP Client’/ Gets the status of the DHCP Client Service
Stop-Process -ProcessName explorer Stops the explorer process (It will auto-restart.)
Get-ComputerInfo | Out-File “C:\
Users\TestUser\Documents\MyTestDocs\
ComputerInfo.txt”
Gets information about your local computer and
redirects it to a file
● Installing and removing applications from systems
● Gathering information from network nodes, such as their IP address and MAC address information
● Initiating updates for various applications and the operating system itself
As you further explore scripting, you may want to start learning to script by writing one to rename files or collect information from computers on your network.

In Figure 21-26, the green lines with double number signs indicate that a line is a comment. Comment lines are
not read during the execution of a script and are only there for documentation within the script. Comments
are often used to document what the command below the comment is doing. Using comments in this way is a
best practice when writing scripts. Someone may have to edit your script later, and comments can help them
understand what is happening at each step in the script.

The PowerShell ISE contains all the commands that can be run within your Windows environment. In enterprise
networks, additional command modules can be added to support domain-wide administrative functions, including creating domain users and email accounts and deploying Windows installations to remote systems across the
network.
Let’s look at another PowerShell script, shown in Figure 21-27. Each line that begins with a # is a comment. In
the image, you can see that the script is automating a variety of tasks.
Figure 21-27 An Advanced PowerShell script with comments
Exam Tip
The A1 Core 2 exam expects you to be familiar with scripts used for basic automation, restarting machines, remapping
network drives, installing applications, automating backups, gathering information, and initiating updates. You are not
expected to know how to write these scripts or understand each command line in a script.
Now that we have explored PowerShell, let’s turn our attention back to Linux and how scripts are written for
that operating system.
Line 4 is asking for the administrator’s log in credentials and then storing them. This is useful if there is a need
for the credentials at any point in the script. Line 8 is connecting a remote network share folder to the local machine.
The folder will show up as the drive letter S. This is sometimes called mounting a network share.
Lines 13 and 14 are installing an application using the .exe file that is located on the newly mounted network
share. Lines 19–28 are collecting and displaying information about the computer. In this example, the computer’s
name, its operating system, its processor information, and the amount of installed memory will be displayed.
Using a script can assist a technician in gathering information from the systems on a network to create an accurate
inventory—making an administrator’s life somewhat easier.
Lines 31 and 32 are installing the Windows Update module to the local system’s PowerShell and using the Get-WindowsUpdate cmdlet to update the local system. In enterprise environments, this is extremely helpful to ensure all the
network computers stay updated. Finally, in line 35, the script will restart the computer after a period of 240 seconds.

Using Scripts to Assist in Backups of Linux Directories
Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 4.8
Scripts can also be used to simplify the process of backing up important directories in Linux. This script will create
a backup of the directories identified in Table 21-2 earlier in this module.
1. Start your Ubuntu VM, and log in using your user name and password.
2. Open a terminal window by selecting the Terminal app from the Apps menu.
3. Type the commands in Table 21-9, pressing the Enter key after each line.
After it is complete, you should have something that looks like the script in the upper-left portion of
Figure 21-28. The lower portion of Figure 21-28 shows the backup file that was created with the script. Your file name
will be different because the date and time will be unique to your system and when you ran the script.
Applying Concepts
Command Purpose
#!/bin/sh Loads the correct interpreter for your script
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-
%d-%H%M%S)
Uses the system’s date and time and formats it so we can use it as the file
name
%Y is the year, %m is the month, %d is the day, %H is the hour, %M is
minute, and %S is second.
By using this command, we create a unique file name each time the script
is run.
BACKUP_DIR=”/” Records the directory you want to save the backup to. In this example, we
are saving the backup in the root directory.
SOURCE=”/etc /home /
opt /root /var”
Describes the files you want to back up
tar -cvf $BACKUP_DIR/
backup-$DATE.tar.gz
$SOURCE
Creates the backup of our listed directories. The tar command stands for
tape archive, and the -cvf options mean the following:
-c: Creates the Archive
-v: Displays Verbose information
-f: Creates the archive with the given file name
Echo “Backup
completed”
Displays the words “Backup completed” after the backup finishes

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.
You can also make use of computer programming fundamentals to create a script in which a portion of the
script only runs if a certain condition is met. An example of this would be a script that checks for the last time the
computer checked for updates, and if the time since the last update check exceeds three days, it runs the update
check. Other examples include checking for directories and files that have been modified or changed since a certain
date and listing those files for the technician or only installing an application if it has not already been installed.
The script in Figure 21-29 is used to check the status of the ClamAV installed during this module. First, there is
a check to see if a network connection to the Internet has been established. Then, there is a check of the installed
signature file and a comparison to the version found on the ClamAV server. The comparison of the installed signature
file and the version on the ClamAV server is only able to run if there is a network connection. The installed version
on the local computer is then checked and compared with the version on the server.

Another use of these conditional operations could involve checking if a file has been modified or changed since
the last backup ran, and if a file has changed, it is included in the next backup.
Scripting Security Considerations
There is also the chance that scripts could be used for malicious reasons. They can be used to download malware to a
system, maliciously change system settings, or even cause a system to crash due to overloaded use of system resources.
For instance, a Microsoft Excel file with embedded scripts, called macros, stored in the cells of the spreadsheet,
could contain malware. When a user opens the Excel file, the macros can activate, downloading malware from a
malware server on the Internet. The malware can then be used to create a backdoor into the user’s system or gather
information from the network to send off to a potential adversary.
Therefore, it is best to ensure that only authorized scripts are allowed on your network and that standard users,
by default, do not have permission to run scripts. This can be controlled by using local and remote group policies
within the operating system or from a server that manages domain policy. How to use Group Policy in a Windows
domain is covered in the module “Securing and Sharing Windows Resources.”
When using scripts, you should also be mindful of the changes that are made to the system settings by the script.
For example, a script may be used to uninstall several applications; however, the script might also inadvertently
remove a file during the uninstall process that is needed by another program on the computer. This can be caused
by applications sharing files or a newer version of an application using an old version of a file. An administrator
would have to then spend time reinstalling the missing file or recovering it from a backup. This can cause a delay in
the technician’s already busy day.
It is also wise to review how a script is accessing and using system resources such as memory or the computer
processor. Overuse or misuse of system resources can lead to an application malfunction or even a total system
crash. Legitimate scripts that are written in JavaScript are sometimes found on webpages and run within your web
browser. Some malicious JavaScript scripts found within a webpage can also be used to steal user credentials from
your computer or personal data from your browsing history. They can even cause the browser application to crash
because it malfunctioned or ran out of allocated memory. Therefore, you should be cautious when running scripts
that were downloaded from the Internet or from unknown sources.

As you can see, learning to script can be helpful in completing the day-to-day tasks of a computer technician. By
using a script, you can save time by automating processes that repeat themselves, such as updating a computer, collecting important system information for inventory, or simply copying files and installing or uninstalling applications.
Module Summary
Linux Operating System
● Distributions of Linux provide a shell prompt in the Linux terminal and might also provide a desktop with
a GUI. The default command-line shell for Linux is the Bash shell.
● Ubuntu Desktop with its windows manager offers Ubuntu software to install apps and update Ubuntu.
● The root account in Linux has access to all features of the OS. When logged in to the root account, the user
is called the superuser.
● Important Linux commands include apt-get, cat, chmod, chown, cp, df, dig, find, grep, ip, ls, man, mv, nano,
ps, pwd, rm, top, and yum.
● Telnet and SSH can be used to remotely access a Linux computer. Telnet transmissions are not secured.
All SSH transmissions are encrypted, and SSH is the preferred method of remote access for Linux and Unix
systems.
● Windows and macOS are popular OSs for desktops and laptops, and Linux is popular as an application server
OS. For compatibility, the FAT32 file system can be used by Windows, macOS, and Linux.
● Samba can be used to share files and share printer resources between the operating systems.
Scripting Software and Techniques
● Scripts are executed in a run-time environment without first being compiled like programs are.
● Script file types include batch files, PowerShell scripts, VBScript, shell scripts (for Linux and UNIX), Python
scripts, and JavaScript.
Uses for Scripting
● Scripts may be used to automate administrative processes, restart machines, map network storage drives,
install and remove applications, perform system updates, back up files, and even gather information from
your network devices.
● Careful testing, reviewing, and monitoring of scripts is necessary to protect the integrity of the operating
system and hardware resources.

Practicing Linux Commands
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.11
Practice the Linux commands listed in Table 21-10 using the Ubuntu Server VM you created earlier in this module.
You could also use the Live Ubuntu on a USB you created in the Core 1 module “Hard Drives and Other Storage.” As
you complete the commands, you’ll examine the directory structure, create a new directory, and put a blank file in it.
Hands-On Project 21-1
Task Command Description
1 ls -l Lists files and directories in the current directory; in Linux,
a directory is treated more like a file than it is in a Windows
directory
2 pwd Displays the full path to the current directory; when you first
log in to a system, that directory is /home/username
3 mkdir mydir Creates a directory named mydir; the directory is created in
the current directory
4 cd mydir Goes to the directory you just created in the /home/username
directory
5 touch myfile Creates a blank file named myfile in the current directory
6 ls Lists the current directory’s contents

Using Telnet and SSH
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.11
Following directions given earlier in the module, install Telnet and SSH in your Ubuntu Server VM. If you get an error,
Ubuntu Server might need updating. Commands to update Ubuntu are also given in the module.
On your Windows host computer, turn on Telnet Client from the Programs and Features area of Control Panel.
Open a command prompt window, and remote in to your Ubuntu Server VM using both Telnet and SSH. Alternatively,
you can use the PuTTY program shown in the module “Securing and Sharing Windows Resources” to complete this.
Hands-On Project 21-3
Changing Permissions for an Ubuntu Directory
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.11
Follow these steps to change permissions for your home directory and then create a new user account to test these
permissions:
1. Create a new user account named nadia. Log in to Ubuntu Server as nadia, and try to copy a file to your
own home directory. For example, you can run this command to make a new copy of the mymemo file you
created earlier in this module:
cp mymemo mymemo.nadia
When you do so, permission is denied.
2. Log back in to Ubuntu Server with your own account.
3. To install the chmod command, enter this command:
sudo apt-get install coreutils
4. Run the chmod command to give full read, write, and execute permissions to everyone for your home
directory.
5. Log out and log back in to the system as nadia, and verify that the user nadia can now copy a file to your
home directory.

Using Google Cloud Platform to Create a Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM
and Update the OS
Est. Time: 45 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.11
Recall from the Core 1 module “Network Infrastructure and Cloud Computing” that Google Cloud Platform offers a
PaaS that you can use to experiment with other operating systems. To use the service to create a Red Hat Enterprise
Linux VM, do the following:
1. Go to cloud.google.com and click Get started for free. You will need to sign in using a Google account. If
you don’t have an account, you can create one with any valid email address.
2. In the Developers Console, create a new project. Then drill down into Compute, Compute Engine, and VM
instances. You will need to enable the API for the project. Create a VM instance with the latest RHEL version
(RHEL 7 at the time of this writing) as the installed OS. Then wait several minutes for Google to create the
instance.
3. Note the External IP assigned to the VM instance. Click SSH. In the drop-down menu that appears, click
Open in browser window, and remote in to your VM using the SSH utility. The VM opens in a separate
window where you can use Linux commands to navigate the directory structure (see Figure 21-30). Try
updating the OS using the yum command by typing: sudo yum update.

4. You can also try using other commands, such as df, to check the disk space and file systems on your VM or
even try creating, editing, copying, and moving files. You can refer to Table 21-3 or use the manual pages to
complete the following tasks:
a. Create and edit a new file in the home directory named testfile.
b. Create a directory in your home directory named data and copy the testfile from the home directory to
the data directory.
c. Delete the testfile from the home directory.
d. Change permissions or ownership of the testfile that is in the data directory so the root account is the
owner and has full permissions for the testfile.
e. Search for a specific word in the testfile.
f. View network interface configurations.
5. After you are finished, shut down the VM by running the sudo shutdown command.
Configuring Network Adapters
Est. Time: 15 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.11
A user reports that their Ubuntu virtual machine cannot access the Internet. After taking control of the VM, you
identify the following:
● The network card is enabled.
● The web browser is not loading linux.org.
● Other users are not reporting any issues browsing the Internet.
You suspect there is a problem with the network settings, and you will need to reconfigure the adapter to support full network connectivity. You decide that troubleshooting this error will be easily fixed through the terminal.
1. What command would you run to verify the current network card ip configuration?
2. You are shown that the inet address is 169.254.9.18. What does this information tell you? Describe how you
might correct this problem using the terminal.
3. After performing the first two steps, you are shown a new ip address of 192.168.128.14. How can you verify
connectivity to linux.org?
Real Problem 21-2
When you set up your Google Cloud account, your credit card information was required. If you’re now done
with your Google Cloud 90-day free trial, close your billing account so your credit card will not be charged
at the end of your free trial period. Click the three-bar icon on the far-left side of the blue Google Cloud
Platform menu bar, and click Billing. Then select Account management, and click CLOSE BILLING ACCOUNT
at the top. Google normally will not automatically charge you after the trial period ends unless you upgrade
your account to a full account, but it’s better to be safe and close your billing account to prevent any unnecessary problems.

Installing and Using Samba
Est. Time: 30 minutes
Core 2 Objective: 1.11
Remember that Samba can be used to share files and printers between Linux and Windows systems. For this activity,
you will need both your Windows 10 VM from the module “Installing Windows” and your Ubuntu VM from earlier in
this module. Ensure both VMs are started and running, and then complete the following steps:
1. In the Ubuntu VM, open the terminal window, and run the following:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
Enter your sudo password, and then press Enter. When asked if you want to continue, press Enter.
Figure 21-31 shows the installation of Samba in terminal.

2. Now that Samba is installed, you need to create a directory for Samba to share with the network. Type the
following command into the terminal window, substituting your user name where <username> is shown:
mkdir /home/<username>/sambashare/
3. Now that the directory you want to share is created, you need to ensure that the Samba configuration file
includes it as a shared item for the network. Run the sudo /nano /etc/<username>/sambashare
command in terminal, and then add the following lines to the end of the file:
[sambashare]
 comment = Samba on Ubuntu
 path = /home/<username>/sambashare
 read only = no
 browsable = yes
Then press Ctrl1O to save and Ctrl1X to exit the nano editor. Figure 21-32 shows the lines added to the
end of the file. They are highlighted in white.
4. Restart the smbd service by running the sudo service smbd restart command. Then, allow Samba
traffic through the Ubuntu firewall by running the sudo ufw allow samba command, as shown in
Figure 21-33.

5. Next, you will set up a user for the Samba service by entering the following command (using your own
Ubuntu user account name):
sudo smbpasswd -a username
Enter your desired password twice, and then close the terminal. Be sure to remember this password, as
you will need it to connect from your Windows VM and access the shared directory.
6. To view the sambashare folder, click the sambashare folder icon on the left side of the Ubuntu desktop.
The sambashare folder should be shown in the Home directory, as shown in Figure 21-34. Any documents
or files that are placed in the sambashare directory can now be accessed across the network. Add a
document or file to the sharefolder by first creating the document using LibreOffice writer or another
software application and then saving it in the correct sambashare directory of your home directory. You can
see an example Accounts.txt file is saved to the proper directory in Figure 21-35.

7. To access the files that are shared via samba from your Windows 10 VM, first connect to your VM, and
then open File Explorer from the taskbar. Type the following into the directory path: \\ip-address\
sambashare.
Be sure to use the correct ip address of your Ubuntu VM in place of the word ip-address. This can be found
by running the ifconfig command from the terminal window. You will be prompted to enter your
Ubuntu user name and password.
8. You should now be able to see the file you saved in step 6 in File Explorer. See Figure 21-36, and note that
the example Accounts.txt file is shown.
9. Alternatively, you could connect from your host machine to the sambashare directory. If you are
using Windows as your host OS, follow step 7. If you are on a Mac, use the Finder menu, and select
Go > Connect, and then enter the following: smb://ip-address/sambashare
Again, be sure to change “ip-address” to the Ubuntu VM’s.

Introduction
In this appendix, we discuss electricity and how it is measured. Then we address the very important topics of how
to protect yourself and equipment when working on computer hardware and networks from electricity and other
potential hazards. Finally, we turn our attention to protecting the environment when performing your duties as an
IT technician.
Measures and Properties of Electricity
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
In our modern world, we take electricity for granted, but we miss it terribly when it’s cut off. Nearly everyone
depends on it, but few really understand it. A successful hardware technician does not expect to encounter failed
processors, fried motherboards, smoking monitors, or frizzed hair. To avoid these excitements, you need to understand how to measure electricity and how to protect computer equipment from its damaging power.
Let’s start with the basics. To most people, volts, ohms, joules, watts, and amps are vague terms that
simply mean electricity. All these terms can be used to measure some characteristic of electricity, as listed
in Table A-1.
Unit Definition Computer Example
Volt (for example, 115 V) Electrical force is measured in volts.
The symbol for volts is V.
A power supply steps down the voltage from
115 V house current to levels of 3.3, 5, and 12
V that computer components can use.
Amp or ampere
(for example, 1.5 A)
An amp is a measure of electrical
current. The symbol for amps is A.
An LCD monitor requires about 5 A to
operate. A small laser printer uses about 2 A.
An optical drive uses about 1 A.
Ohm (for example, 20 Ω) An ohm is a measure of resistance to
electricity. The symbol for ohm is Ω.
Current can flow in typical computer cables
and wires with a resistance of near zero Ω.
Joule (for example, 500 J) A joule is a measure of work or
energy. One joule (pronounced
“jewel”) is the work required to push
an electrical current of 1 A through
a resistance of 1 Ω. The symbol for
joule is J.
A surge suppressor (see Figure A-1) is rated
in joules—the higher the better. The rating
determines how much work a device can
expend before it can no longer protect the
circuit from a power surge. To protect against
lightning, use a suppressor rated at 2000
joules or higher.
Watt (for example, 20 W) A watt is a measure of the total
electrical power needed to operate
a device. One watt is one joule per
second. Watts can be calculated
by multiplying volts by amps. The
symbol for watts is W.
The power consumption of an LCD computer
monitor is rated at about 14 W. A DVD burner
uses about 25 W when burning a DVD.

Now let’s look at how electricity gets from one place to another and how it is used in house circuits and
computers.
AC and DC
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
Electricity can be either AC or DC. Alternating current (AC) goes back and forth, or oscillates, rather than traveling
in only one direction. House current in the United States is AC and oscillates 60 times in one second (60 hertz). Voltage in the system is constantly alternating from positive to negative, which causes the electricity to flow first in one
direction and then in the other. Voltage alternates from +115 V to −115 V. AC is the most economical way to transmit
electricity to our homes and workplaces. By decreasing current and increasing voltage, we can force alternating current to travel great distances. When alternating current reaches its destination, it is made more suitable for driving
our electrical devices by decreasing voltage and increasing current.
Direct current (DC) travels in only one direction and is the type of current that most electronic devices, including computers, require. A rectifier is a device that converts AC to DC, and an inverter is a device that converts DC
to AC. A transformer is a device that changes the ratio of voltage to current. The power supply used in computers
is both a rectifier and a transformer.
Large transformers reduce the high voltage on power lines coming to your neighborhood to a lower voltage
before the current enters your home. The transformer does not change the amount of power in this closed system;
if it decreases voltage, it increases current. The overall power stays constant, but the ratio of voltage to current
changes, as illustrated in Figure A-2.
Figure A-1 A surge suppressor protects electrical equipment from power surges
and is rated in joules
Rating is
720 joules
To learn more about how volts, amps, ohms, joules, and watts measure the properties of electricity, see “Electricity and
Multimeters” in the student companion site that accompanies this text at cengage.com.

The neutral line to your house is grounded many times along its way (in fact, at each electrical pole) and is
also grounded at the breaker box where the electricity enters your house. You can look at a three-prong plug and
see the three lines: hot, neutral, and ground (see Figure A-3). When grounding the device is not important, either a
polarized plug (hot and neutral are designated) or a non-polarized plug (hot and neutral depend on how the plug is
inserted in the outlet) can be used.
Again, direct current flows in only one direction. Think of electrical current like a current of water that flows
from a state of high pressure to a state of low pressure or rest. Electrical current flows from a high-pressure state
(called hot) to a state of rest (called ground or neutral). For a power supply, a power line may be either 15 or 25
volts in one circuit or 112 or 212 volts in another circuit. The positive or negative value is determined by how the
circuit is oriented, either on one side of the power output or the other. Several circuits coming from the power supply accommodate different devices with different power requirements.
Hot, Neutral, and Ground
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
AC travels on a hot line from a power station to a building and returns to the power station on a neutral line. When
the two lines reach the building and enter an electrical device, such as a lamp, the device controls the flow of
electricity between the hot and neutral lines. If an easier path (one with less resistance) is available, the electricity
follows that path. This can cause a short, a sudden increase in flow that can also create a sudden increase in temperature—enough to start a fire and injure both people and equipment. Never put yourself in a position where you
are the path of least resistance between the hot line and ground!
Figure A-2 A transformer keeps power constant but
changes the ratio of current to voltage
Power Power

More voltage More current

Caution
It’s very important that computer components be properly grounded. Never connect a computer to an outlet or use
an extension cord that doesn’t have the third ground plug. The third line can prevent a short from causing extreme
damage. In addition, the bond between the neutral and ground helps eliminate electrical noise (stray electrical signals)
within the computer that is sometimes caused by other nearby electrical equipment.
Caution
Beware of the different uses of black wire. In desktop computers and in DC circuits, black is used for ground, but in
home wiring and in AC circuits, black is used for hot!
To prevent uncontrolled electricity in a short, the neutral line is grounded. Grounding a line means that the
line is connected directly to the earth; in the event of a short, the electricity flows into the earth and not back to
the power station. Grounding serves as an escape route for out-of-control electricity because the earth is always
capable of accepting a flow of current. A surge suppressor can be used to protect a computer and its components
against power surges.

House AC voltage in the United States is about 110–120 V, but in other countries, this is not always the case. In many
other countries, the standard is 220 V. Outlet styles also vary from one country to the next.

Now that you know about electricity, let’s discuss how to protect yourself against the dangers of electricity and
other factors that might harm you as you work around computers.
Protecting Yourself
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
To protect yourself against electrical shock when working with any electrical device—including computers, printers, scanners, and network devices—disconnect the power if you notice a dangerous situation that might lead to
electrical shock or fire. When you disconnect the power, do so by pulling on the plug at the AC outlet. To protect
the power cord, don’t pull on the cord itself. Also, don’t just turn off the on/off switch on the device; you need to
actually disconnect the power. Note that any of the following can indicate a potential danger:
● You notice smoke coming from the computer case, or the case feels unusually warm.
● The power cord is frayed or otherwise damaged in any way.
● Water or other liquid is on the floor around the device or was spilled on it.
● The device has been exposed to excess moisture.
● The device has been dropped, or you notice physical damage.
● You smell a strong electronics odor.
● The power supply or fans are making a whining noise.

Safely Working Inside Computers, Printers, and
Other Electrical Devices
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
To stay safe, always do the following before working inside computers, printers, and other electrical devices:
● Remove jewelry. Remove any jewelry that might come in contact with components. Jewelry is commonly
made of metal and might conduct electricity if it touches a component. It can also get caught in cables and
cords inside computer cases.
● Power down the system and unplug it. For a desktop computer, unplug the power, monitor, mouse, and
keyboard cables, unplug any other peripherals or cables attached, and move them out of your way.
● For a computer, press and hold down the power button for a moment. After you unplug the computer,
press the power button for about three seconds to completely drain the power supply. Sometimes when
you do so, you’ll hear the fans quickly start and go off as residual power is drained. Only then is it safe to
work inside the case.
Electrical Fire Safety
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
Never use water to put out a fire fueled by electricity because water is a conductor and you might get a severe electrical shock. A computer lab needs a fire extinguisher that is rated to put out electrical fires. Fire extinguishers are
rated by the type of fires they put out:
● Class A extinguishers can use water to put out fires caused by wood, paper, and other combustibles.
● Class B extinguishers can put out fires caused by liquids such as gasoline, kerosene, and oil.
● Class C fire extinguishers use nonconductive chemicals to put out a fire caused by electricity (see Figure A-4).

Proper Use of Cleaning Pads and Solutions
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
As a support technician, you’ll find yourself collecting different cleaning solutions and cleaning pads to clean a
variety of devices, including the mouse and keyboard, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs and their drives, and monitors.
Figure A-5 shows a few of these products. For example, the contact cleaner in the figure is used to clean the contacts
on the edge connectors of expansion cards; a good cleaning can solve a problem with a faulty connection.
Figure A-5 Cleaning solutions and pads
Figure A-6 Each chemical you use should have
a material safety data sheet (MSDS)
available
Most of these cleaning solutions contain flammable
and poisonous materials. Take care when using them
so they don’t get on your skin or in your eyes. To find
out what to do if you are accidentally exposed to a dangerous solution, look at the instructions printed on the
can or check out the material safety data sheet (see
Figure A-6). A material safety data sheet (MSDS) explains
how to properly handle substances such as chemical solvents and how to dispose of them.
An MSDS includes information such as physical
data, toxicity, health effects, first aid, storage, shipping, disposal, and spill procedures. The MSDS comes
packaged with the chemical; you can also order one
from the manufacturer or find one on the Internet (see
ilpi.com/msds).

If you have an accident with cleaning solutions or other dangerous products, your company or organization
might require you to report the accident and/or fill out an incident report. Check with your organization to find out
how to report these types of incidents.
Managing Cables
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
People can trip over cables or cords left on the floor, so be careful that cables are in a safe place. If you must
run a cable across a path or where someone sits, use a cable or cord cover that can be nailed or screwed to the
floor. Don’t leave loose cables or cords in a traffic area where people can trip over them; such objects are called
trip hazards.
Lifting Heavy Objects
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
Back injury caused by lifting heavy objects is one of the most common work injuries. Whenever possible, put heavy
objects, such as a large laser printer, on a cart to move them. If you do need to lift a heavy object, follow these
guidelines to keep from injuring your back:
1. Look at the object and decide which side of it to face so the load will be the most balanced when
you lift it.
2. Stand close to the object with your feet apart.
3. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees and grip the load.
4. Lift with your legs, arms, and shoulders, not with your back or stomach.
5. Keep the load close to your body, and avoid twisting your body while you’re holding the load.
6. To put the object down, keep your back as straight as you can, and lower the object by bending your
knees.
Don’t try to lift an object that is too heavy for you. Because there are no exact guidelines for when heavy is too
heavy, use your best judgment as to when to ask for help.
Safety Goggles and Air Filter Mask
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
If you work in a factory environment where flying fragments, chips, or other particles are about, your employer
might require you to wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. In addition, if the air is filled with dust or other contaminants, your employer might require you to wear an air-purifying respirator, commonly called an air filtration
mask, which filters out the dust and other contaminants. If safety goggles or a mask is required, your employer is
responsible for providing one that is appropriate for your work environment.
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to know how to use MSDS documentation to dispose of chemicals and help protect
the environment. You also need to know that you must follow all local government regulations when disposing of
chemicals and other materials dangerous to the environment.

Protecting the Equipment
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
As you learn to troubleshoot and solve computer problems, you gradually begin to realize that many of them could
have been avoided by good computer maintenance, which includes protecting the computer against environmental
factors such as humidity, dust, and out-of-control electricity.
Protect the Equipment Against Static Electricity or ESD
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
Suppose you come indoors on a cold day, pick up a comb, and touch your hair. Sparks fly! What happened? Static
electricity caused the sparks. Electrostatic discharge (ESD), commonly known as static electricity, is an electrical
charge at rest. When you came indoors, this charge built up on your hair and had no place to go. An ungrounded
conductor (such as wire that is not touching another wire) or a nonconductive surface (such as your hair) holds
a charge until it is released. When two objects with dissimilar electrical charges touch, electricity passes between
them until the dissimilar charges become equal.
To see static charges equalizing, turn off the lights in a room, scuff your feet on the carpet, and touch another
person. Occasionally, you can see and feel the charge in your fingers. If you can feel the charge, you discharged at
least 1500 volts of static electricity. If you hear the discharge, you released at least 6000 volts. If you see the discharge, you released at least 8000 volts of ESD. A charge of only 10 volts can damage electronic components! You
can touch a chip on an expansion card or motherboard, damage the chip with ESD, and never feel, hear, or see the
electrical discharge.
ESD can cause two types of damage to an electronic component: catastrophic failure and upset failure. A catastrophic failure destroys the component beyond use. An upset failure damages the component so it does not perform
well, even though it may still function to some degree. Upset failures are more difficult to detect because they are
not consistent and not easily observed. Both types of failures permanently affect the device. Components are easily
damaged by ESD, but because the damage might not show up for weeks or months, a technician may get careless
and not realize the damage they are doing.
Caution
Unless you are measuring power levels with a multimeter or power supply tester, never touch a component or cable
inside a computer case while the power is on. The electrical voltage is not enough to seriously hurt you but is more
than enough to permanently damage the component.
Before touching or handling a component (for example, a hard drive, motherboard, expansion card, processor,
or memory modules), protect it against ESD by always grounding yourself first. You can ground yourself and the
computer parts by using one or more of the following static control devices or methods:
● ESD strap. An ESD strap, also called a ground bracelet, antistatic wrist strap, or ESD bracelet, is a strap
you wear around your wrist. The strap has a cord attached with an alligator clip on the end. Attach
the clip to the computer case you’re working on, as shown in Figure A-7. Any static electricity between
you and the case will be discharged. Therefore, as you work inside the case, you will not damage the
components with static electricity. The bracelet also contains a resistor that prevents electricity from
harming you.

Figure A-8 An ESD mat dissipates ESD and should be connected to the ground
Caution
When working on a laser printer, don’t wear the ESD strap. You don’t want to be the ground for these high-voltage
devices.
● Ground mats. A ground mat, also called an ESD mat, dissipates ESD and is commonly used by bench technicians (also called depot technicians) who repair and assemble computers at their workbenches or in an
assembly line. Ground mats have a connector in one corner that you can use to connect the mat to the
ground (see Figure A-8). If you lift a component off the mat, it is no longer grounded and is susceptible to
ESD, so it’s important to use an ESD strap with a ground mat.

● Static shielding bags. New components come shipped in static shielding bags, also called antistatic bags.
These bags are a type of Faraday cage (named after Michael Faraday, who built the first cage in 1836). A Faraday cage is any device that protects against an electromagnetic field. Save the bags to store other devices
that belong in a computer but are not currently installed. As you work on a computer, know that a device
is not protected from ESD if you place it on top of the bag; the protection is inside the bag (see Figure A-9).
Figure A-9 An antistatic bag helps protect components from ESD
Caution
An older CRT monitor can also damage components with ESD. Don’t place or store expansion cards on top of or next
to a CRT monitor, which can discharge as much as 29,000 volts onto the screen.
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam emphasizes that you should know how to protect computer equipment as you work on it, including
how to protect components against damage from ESD.
The best way to guard against ESD is to use an ESD strap together with a ground mat. Consider an ESD strap
essential equipment when working on a computer. However, if you are in a situation in which you must work without one, touch the computer case or the power supply before you touch a component in the case, which is called
self-grounding. Self-grounding dissipates any charge between you and whatever you touch. Here are some rules
that can help protect computer parts against ESD:
● When passing a circuit board, memory module, or other sensitive component to another person, ground
yourself and then touch the other person before you pass the component.
● Leave components inside their protective bags until you are ready to use them.
● Work on hard floors, not carpet, or use antistatic spray on the carpet.
● Don’t work on a computer if you or the computer has just come in from the cold because there is more
danger of ESD when the atmosphere is cold and dry.
● When unpacking hardware or software, remove the packing tape and cellophane from the work area as soon
as possible because these materials attract ESD.
● Keep components away from your hair and clothing.

When working at a customer site, be sure to clean up any mess you created by blowing dust out of a computer case
or keyboard.
Note 3
Physically Protect Your Equipment from the Environment
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
When you protect equipment from ongoing problems with the environment, you are likely to have fewer problems later, and you will have less troubleshooting and repair to do. Here is how you can physically protect a
computer:
● Protect a computer against dust and other airborne particles. When a computer must sit in a dusty
environment, around those who smoke, or where pets might leave hair, you can take the following actions
to protect it:
■ Use a plastic keyboard cover to protect the keyboard. When the computer is turned off, protect the
entire system with a cover or enclosure.
■ Install air filters over the front or side vents of the case where air flows in. Put your hand over the case
of a running computer to feel where the air flows in. For most systems, air flows in from the front vents,
or it vents on the side of the case that is near the processor cooler. The air filter shown in Figure A-10
has magnets that hold the filter to the case when screw holes are not available.
Figure A-10 This air filter is designed to fit over a case fan,
power supply fan, or panel vent on the case
■ Use compressed air or an antistatic vacuum (see Figure A-11) to remove dust from inside the case,
if you have the case cover open. Figure A-12 shows a case fan that jammed because of dust and
caused a system to overheat. While you’re cleaning up dust, don’t forget to blow or vacuum out the
keyboard.

● Allow for good ventilation inside and outside the system. Proper air circulation is essential to keeping a
system cool. Don’t block air vents on the front and rear of the computer case or on the monitor. Inside the
case, make sure cables are tied up and out of the way so as to allow for airflow and not obstruct fans from
turning. Put covers on expansion slot openings at the rear of the case and put faceplates over empty bays
on the front of the case. Don’t set a tower case directly on thick carpet because the air vent on the bottom
front of the case can be blocked. If you are concerned about overheating, monitor temperatures inside and
outside the case.

● High temperatures and humidity can be dangerous for hard drives. I once worked in a basement with PCs,
and hard drives failed much too often. After I installed dehumidifiers, the hard drives became more reliable.
If you suspect a problem with room humidity, you can monitor it using a hygrometer. High temperatures can
also damage computer equipment, and you should take precautions not to allow a computer to overheat.
Figure A-13 A surge protector by APC for Ethernet lines
The temperature and humidity in a server room where computers are located and people don’t spend long hours are
usually set to balance the needs of the equipment and the need to conserve energy. Low temperatures and moderate
humidity are best for the equipment, although no set standards exist for either temperatures or humidity. Temperatures might be set from 65ºF to 70ºF and humidity between 30% and 50%, although some companies keep their server
rooms at 80ºF to conserve energy. A data center where both computers and people stay is usually kept at a comfortable
temperature and humidity for humans.
Note 4
Exam Tip
The A+ Core 2 exam expects you to know how to keep computers and monitors well ventilated and to use protective
enclosures and air filters to protect the equipment from airborne particles.
● Protect electrical equipment from power surges. Lightning and other electrical power surges can destroy
computers and other electrical equipment. If a house or office building does not have surge protection
equipment installed at the breaker box, be sure to install a protective device at each computer. The least
expensive device is a power strip that is also a surge suppressor, although you might want to use an uninterruptible power supply for added protection.
Lightning can also get to your equipment across network cabling coming in through an Internet connection. To
protect against lightning, use a surge suppressor such as the one shown in Figure A-13 in line between the ISP device
(for example, a DSL modem or cable modem) and the computer or home router to protect it from spikes across the
network cables. Notice the cord on the surge suppressor, which connects it to ground.

An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a device that raises the voltage when it drops during under-voltage
events, called brownouts or sags (temporary voltage reductions). A UPS also does double duty as a surge suppressor to protect the system against power surges or spikes. In addition, a UPS can serve as a battery backup to
provide enough power for a brief time during a total power failure, called a blackout, so you can save your work
and shut down the system. A UPS is not as essential for a laptop computer as it is for a desktop because a laptop
has a battery that can sustain it during a blackout. Also, consider using a UPS to protect power to a router, switch,
or other essential network device.
A common UPS device is a rather heavy box that plugs into an AC outlet and provides one or more electrical
outlets and perhaps Ethernet and USB ports (see Figure A-14). It has an on/off switch, requires no maintenance, and
is very simple to install. Use it to provide uninterruptible power to your desktop computer, monitor, and essential
network devices. It’s best not to connect a UPS to nonessential devices such as a laser printer or scanner. The UPS
shown in Figure A-14 has a USB port so a computer can monitor power management and network ports to block
harmful voltage on the network.
If a power outage occurs and you don’t have a reliable power conditioner installed at the breaker box in your house
or building, unplug all power cords to the computers, printers, monitors, and peripherals. Sometimes when the power
returns, sudden spikes are accompanied by another brief outage. You don’t want to subject your equipment to these
surges. When buying a surge suppressor, look for one that guarantees protection against damage from lightning and
that reimburses for equipment destroyed while the surge suppressor is in use.

Protecting the Environment
Core 2 Objectives 4.4, 4.5
IT support technicians need to be aware that they can do damage to the environment if they dispose of used computer equipment improperly. As a support technician, one day you’re sure to face an assortment of useless equipment and consumables (see Figure A-15). Before you decide to trash it all, take a moment and ask yourself if some
of the equipment can be donated or at least recycled. Think about fixing up an old computer and donating it to an
underprivileged middle school student. If you don’t have the time for that, consider donating to the local computer
repair class. The class can fix up such computers as a class project and donate them to young students.

When disposing of any type of equipment or consumables, make sure to comply with local government
environmental regulations. Table A-2 lists some items and how to dispose of them.
Figure A-15 Keep, trash, recycle, or donate?
Parts How to Dispose of Them
Alkaline batteries, including AAA, AA,
A, C, D, and 9-volt
Dispose of these batteries in the regular trash. First check to see if there
are recycling facilities in your area.
Button batteries used in digital
cameras and other small equipment;
battery packs used in notebook
computers
These batteries can contain silver oxide, mercury, lithium, or cadmium
and are considered toxic waste that require special toxic waste handling.
Dispose of them by returning them to the original dealer or by taking
them to a recycling center. To recycle, pack them separately from other
items. If you don’t have a recycling center nearby, contact your county for
local disposal regulations.
Cell phones and tablets Most cell phone carriers will buy back old cell phones to recycle or
refurbish. If you can restore the device to factory state, donate it
to charity. Before tossing it in the trash, check with local county or
environmental officials for laws and regulations in your area that cover
proper disposal of the item. E-waste recycling companies, such as Eco-Cell
(eco-cell.com), receive cell phones for resale or recycling.
Laser printer toner cartridges Return these to the manufacturer or dealer to be recycled.
Ink-jet printer cartridges, cell phones,
tablets, computer cases, power
supplies, other computer parts,
monitors, chemical solvents, and
their containers
Check with local county or environmental officials for laws and regulations
in your area that cover proper disposal of these items. The county might
have a recycling center that will receive the items. Discharge a CRT
monitor before disposing of it. See the MSDS documents for chemicals to
know how to dispose of them.
Storage media such as hard drives,
CDs, DVDs, and BDs
As discussed in the module “Security Strategies,” destroy the data on the
media so it is not possible for sensitive data to be stolen. Then the device
can be recycled or put in the trash. Your organization might have to meet
legal requirements to destroy data. If so, make sure you understand these
requirements and how to comply with them.

Windows loads many DLL programs from the following key, which is sometimes used by malicious software.
Don’t delete one unless you know it’s causing a problem:
● HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ShellServiceObjectDelayLoad
Entries in the keys listed next apply to all users and hold legitimate startup entries. Don’t delete an entry unless
you suspect it to be bad:
● HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
● HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
● HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Run
● HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
These keys and their subkeys contain entries pertaining to background services that are sometimes launched
at startup:
● HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunService
● HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
The following key contains a value named BootExecute, which is normally set to autochk. It causes the system to
run a type of Chkdsk program to check for hard drive integrity if it was previously shut down improperly. Sometimes
another program adds itself to this value, causing a problem. The Chkntfs utility can be used to exclude volumes
from being checked by autochk. For more information about this situation, search for “CHKNTFS.EXE: What You Can
Use It For” at support.microsoft.com.
● HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager
Here is an assorted list of registry keys that have all been known to cause various problems at startup. Remember, before you delete a program entry from one of these keys, research the program file name so you don’t accidentally delete something you want to keep:
● HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command
● HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun
● HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\Setup
● HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\load

● HKCR\exefile\shell\open\command
● HKCR\htafile\shell\open\command
● HKCR\piffile\shell\open\command
● HKCR\scrfile\shell\open\command
Finally, check out the subkeys in the following key; they apply to 32-bit programs installed in a 64-bit version
of Windows:
● HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node
Other ways in which processes can be launched at startup include the following:
● Services can be set to launch at startup. To manage services, use the Services console (services.msc).
● Device drivers are launched at startup. For a listing of installed devices, use Device Manager (devmgmt.
msc) or the System Information utility (msinfo32.exe).
